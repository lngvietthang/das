It &apos;s official : U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria . Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night , hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons . There are key questions looming over the debate : What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria ? U.N. inspectors leave Syria . Obama &apos;s remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria , carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb . Bergen : Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. Obama : &apos; This menace must be confronted &apos; . On Saturday , Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . Syria &apos;s alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month &quot; is an assault on human dignity , &quot; the president said . Obama decision came Friday night . Syria : Who wants what after chemical weapons horror . British Prime Minister David Cameron , whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week , responded to Obama &apos;s speech in a Twitter post Saturday . &quot; I understand and support Barack Obama &apos;s position on Syria , &quot; Cameron said . What do Syria &apos;s neighbors think ? . After Obama &apos;s speech , a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is &quot; embarrassed &quot; that Russia opposes military action against Syria , is &quot; crying for help &quot; for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels . An anchor on Syrian state television said Obama &quot; appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies . &quot; . On Saturday , Obama said &quot; all told , well over 1,000 people were murdered . &quot;
( CNN ) -- Usain Bolt rounded off the world championships Sunday by claiming his third gold in Moscow as he anchored Jamaica to victory in the men &apos;s 4x100m relay . The fastest man in the world charged clear of United States rival Justin Gatlin as the Jamaican quartet of Nesta Carter , Kemar Bailey-Cole , Nickel Ashmeade and Bolt won in 37.36 seconds . The U.S finished second in 37.56 seconds with Canada taking the bronze after Britain were disqualified for a faulty handover . The 26-year-old Bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships , equaling the record held by American trio Carl Lewis , Michael Johnson and Allyson Felix , not to mention the small matter of six Olympic titles . &quot; I &apos;m proud of myself and I &apos;ll continue to work to dominate for as long as possible , &quot; Bolt said , having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 Rio Olympics . Gatlin strayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their baton and was never able to get on terms with Bolt . Earlier , Jamaica &apos;s women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold , anchored by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce , who like Bolt was completing a triple . Defending champions , the United States , were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between Alexandria Anderson and English Gardner , but promoted to silver when France were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover . Fraser-Pryce , like Bolt aged 26 , became the first woman to achieve three golds in the 100-200 and the relay . Bolt &apos;s final dash for golden glory brought the eight-day championship to a rousing finale , but while the hosts topped the medal table from the United States there was criticism of the poor attendances in the Luzhniki Stadium .
Kansas City , Missouri ( CNN ) -- The General Services Administration , already under investigation for lavish spending , allowed an employee to telecommute from Hawaii even though he is based at the GSA &apos;s Kansas City , Missouri , office , a CNN investigation has found . Under the program , employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which they &apos;re actually assigned . The Kansas City employee , who started his job in January 2011 , is paid $ 84,440 and works from his home in Honolulu , a GSA representative confirmed . Jason Klumb , the GSA &apos;s regional administrator for Kansas City , defended the hire . &quot; The cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candidacy as an employee as compared with the other applicants , &quot; Klumb said . Klumb called the GSA &apos;s teleworking program &quot; a successful program that &apos;s going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers . &quot; . And a GSA employee in Kansas City , who requested anonymity , said that hiring someone in Hawaii to work for the Kansas City region was ludicrous . &quot; When you consider everything you need when you hire someone , it would have been better to look for someone in the Kansas City area . Dan Tangherlini , who was appointed acting GSA administrator this year , said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program . The GSA &quot; virtual employee &quot; program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including CNN &apos;s parent company , Turner Broadcasting , in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week , partially to reduce traffic congestion . The details requested by Issa about the GSA program have not been provided to the committee . In July , a CNN investigation revealed that the GSA &apos;s Kansas City office spent more than $ 20,000 to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit .
Burkhart , a 24-year-old German national , has been charged with 37 counts of arson following a string of 52 fires in Los Angeles . The charges are in connection with arson fires at 12 locations scattered through Hollywood , West Hollywood and Sherman Oaks , according to authorities . &quot; This defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set , the people believe , upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community , &quot; Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Sean Carney said . The worst arson sprees in the city &apos;s history began last Friday morning with a car fire in Hollywood that spread to apartments above a garage , but no new fires have happened since Burkhart was arrested Monday , Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley said . &quot; In numerous instances , the cars were parked in carports , resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings , &quot; a sworn affidavit from a Los Angeles arson investigator said . &quot; It is my opinion that the defendant &apos;s criminal spree was motivated by his rage against Americans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of Los Angeles as possible , &quot; Nordskog wrote . A search of Burkhart &apos;s Hollywood apartment found newspaper clippings about the Los Angeles fires and articles from Germany reporting similar car fires in Frankfurt , Germany in September , 2011 , the investigator said . &quot; It is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in Germany before he came to the United States , &quot; Nordskog wrote .

( CNN ) -- Thousands on Saturday fled the area in southwestern Ivory Coast where attacks left seven U.N. peacekeepers and eight civilians dead , according to a U.N. official . Humanitarian organizations reported Saturday they were expecting about 4,000 people in Tai , said Remi Dourlot , a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs . Another 35 families crossed the Ivory Coast &apos;s southwest border into U.N. refugee camps in Liberia , and humanitarian groups said hundreds of others had been pushed south by the violence , according to Dourlot . The movement comes after blue-helmeted peacekeepers -- who were in the area because of threats against civilians -- came under attack , the United Nations said in a statement . Besides the U.N. peacekeepers , humanitarian groups reported eight civilians died in violence , said Dourlot . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Friday called on the government of Ivory Coast &quot; to do its utmost to identify the perpetrators and hold them accountable . &quot; U.N. Operation in Cote d &apos;Ivoire and Ivory Coast troops have increased their presence in the area , Dourlot said Saturday .

A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission in Ivory Coast said Friday &apos;s incident was the first attack on peacekeepers since they entered the country in 2004 . U.N. peacekeepers remained in Ivory Coast after the 2010 presidential election , when the country was thrown into crisis after incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo refused to acknowledge defeat to former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara . According to the United Nations , its peacekeeping force in Ivory Coast as of April 30 included nearly 11,000 uniformed personnel , as well as several hundred international civilian personnel , local staff and volunteers .
( CNN ) -- Four groups that advocate for immigrant rights said Thursday they will challenge Arizona &apos;s new immigration law , which allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency . The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , the American Civil Liberties Union , the ACLU of Arizona and the National Immigration Law Center held a news conference Thursday in Phoenix to announce the legal challenge . &quot; This law will only make the rampant racial profiling of Latinos that is already going on in Arizona much worse , &quot; said Alessandra Soler Meetze , executive director of the ACLU of Arizona . Republican Arizona Gov. Brewer and others who support the law say it does not involve racial profiling or any other illegal acts . &quot; It is illegal in America , and it &apos;s certainly illegal in Arizona . &quot; . &quot; Our churches and pastors in Arizona are outraged about the significant threat this anti-immigrant law will have in the lives of Arizona &apos;s Latinos , &quot; said the Rev. The measure makes it a state crime to live or travel through Arizona illegally . In addition to signing the law , Brewer also issued an executive order that requires training for local officers on how to implement the law without engaging in racial profiling or discrimination . Some officials in Arizona have expressed their displeasure with the measure . But a national Republican leader said Thursday that Arizona is just filling a void left by the federal government . The Arizona measure has drawn sharp criticism from the Mexican government , which issued an advisory to its citizens this week . In Arizona , two popular singers also will voice their opposition . Arizona , which is on the Mexican border , has about 460,000 undocumented immigrants , the federal government says . The other states with more illegal immigrants than Arizona are Texas , Florida , New York and Georgia .
That means politicking will be on the rise , especially as control of the Senate is at stake as well as control of 36 state houses . The race with the most at stake is the one for U.S. Senate in Kentucky . This is not just one of the only Senate races Republicans are at risk of losing , but also the race where the top Senate Republican is at risk of losing his job . The Republican leader of the Senate , Mitch McConnell , is in a fight for his political life against Alison Lundergan Grimes , a relatively inexperienced Democratic politician who was just 8 years old when McConnell started his first term in the Senate in 1985 . Meanwhile , Democrats , backed by labor unions , are again fighting to defeat Walker -- they forced a recall two years ago that Walker won -- to move forward on more Democratic economic policies , including lifting the minimum wage . U.S. Senate , Louisiana : Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu always has tough races , and her fourth bid for the Senate seat is no exception . Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy is the person who is giving Landrieu another difficult run . There &apos;s a chance the Louisiana race , and the balance of the Senate , might be dragged out until December . Sen. Mary Landrieu to reimburse Senate for charter flight . National Democrats go after Cassidy on Medicare . U.S. Senate , Iowa : When popular Sen. Tom Harkin decided to retire , Democrats had a small panic attack as this solidly Democratic seat was now in play . But this race could be a bright spot for Democrats . Even in what is expected to be a difficult year for Democrats , Democratic candidate Gwen Graham could pull out a victory in this Republican-leaning district of Tallahassee and the central part of the Florida Panhandle .
Gaza City ( CNN ) -- An Italian humanitarian activist and journalist who was kidnapped in Gaza has been found dead and one person is in custody , the Hamas Interior Ministry said Friday in a statement . Medical sources said his body was taken to Shifa Hospital in Gaza . Arabic writing scrolled over the video threatened that Arrigoni would be killed if Hesham al-Saeedni , who has been held for nearly a year by Hamas , were not released within 30 hours of 11 a.m. Thursday . Al-Saeedni is the leader of a group that may have been inspired by al Qaeda , said Alfredo Tradardi , the Italy coordinator for the International Solidarity Movement , where Arrigoni was a volunteer . Tradardi , who had initially expressed optimism that his co-worker would be released unharmed , told CNN in a telephone interview that the outcome underscores the need for progress to be made toward Middle East peace . Arrigoni had been active in the Palestinian cause for nearly a decade , and had been allied with the International Solidarity Movement for more than two years , &quot; monitoring human rights violations by Israel , supporting the Palestinian popular resistance against the Israeli occupation and disseminating information about the situation in Gaza to his home country of Italy , &quot; the non-governmental organization said in a written statement . He was granted honorary citizenship for his work for the Palestinian people , the statement said . &quot; Vittorio Arrigoni is a hero of Palestine , &quot; said a statement released by Khalil Shaheen , head of the economics and social rights department at the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights . Arrigoni &apos;s colleagues last saw him about 8 p.m. Wednesday near the port in Gaza City , said Joe Catron , a member of the International Solidarity Movement . Arrigoni , who was also working as a freelance journalist , was from the northern Italian region of Lombardy .
( CNN ) -- Renowned radio personality Casey Kasem is in critical condition at a hospital in western Washington , a spokesman for St. Anthony Hospital told CNN in a written statement Thursday . The 82-year-old former host of &quot; American Top 40 &quot; and &quot; Casey &apos;s Top 40 &quot; is receiving antibiotics through IVs , blood pressure support medicine and care for his bed sores , Thompson said . &quot; Any further updates on Mr. Kasem &apos;s condition will be at the discretion and approval of his children , &quot; Thompson said . Danny Deraney , a representative of daughter Kerri Kasem , told CNN that members of the family , including Casey Kasem &apos;s brother , were flying to Washington . When asked if they feared Casey Kasem might die , Deraney said it could be his last moments or he could get better . A patient can be listed as both critical and stable , if his condition is poor but not deteriorating further . Kerri Kasem ; her sister , Julie ; and their brother , Mike Kasem , have contended since last year that Jean Kasem has prevented the three siblings from visiting their father . He had been at a facility in Santa Monica , California , before Jean Kasem took him to Washington state after his daughter Kerri Kasem won temporary conservatorship over her father &apos;s care . Last week , a Washington court granted Kerri Kasem the right to visit her father one hour a day and to have him examined by a doctor . Deraney expected the judge to rule on whether Jean Kasem would have to let Kerri Kasem have more input on where her father lives and who cares for him . Casey Kasem , who was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon &quot; Scooby-Doo &quot; and an announcer for NBC , retired in 2009 . CNN &apos;s Jane Caffrey contributed to this report .
( CNN ) -- If you travel by plane and arriving on time makes a difference , try to book on Hawaiian Airlines . In 2012 , passengers got where they needed to go without delay on the carrier more than nine times out of 10 , according to a study released on Monday . In fact , Hawaiian got even better from 2011 , when it had a 92.8 % on-time performance . Last year , it improved to 93.4 % . The Airline Quality Rankings Report looks at the 14 largest U.S. airlines and is based on an analysis of U.S. Department of Transportation figures . It &apos;s co-authored by Brent Bowen , the head of the Department of Aviation Technology at Purdue University , and Dean Headley of Wichita State . In addition to on-time performance , the joint project looks at three other categories : rate of consumer complaints , mishandled bags and denied boarding performance . At a time when U.S. airlines are a whipping post for passenger complaints about crowded flights , tight seats , costly tickets and unsatisfactory service , there is a glimmer of hope . Eight airlines improved their on-time arrival performance in 2012 . Nine of the 14 rated had an on-time arrival percentage of more than 80 % . ExpressJet and American Airlines had the worst on-time performance ( 76.9 % ) last year , according to the data gathered in the 23rd annual report . Virgin America had the best baggage handling rate of all the airlines ( 0.87 misplaced bags per 1,000 passengers . ) American Eagle showed improvement from 2011 but still came in last , fumbling baggage at a rate of 5.80 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers . When it came to complaints last year , Southwest again had the lowest consumer rate ( 0.25 per 100,000 passengers ) while the distinction of being the airline with the highest consumer complaint rate went to United Airlines ( 4.24 per 100,000 . ) .
( CNN ) For the second time during his papacy , Pope Francis has announced a new group of bishops and archbishops set to become cardinals -- and they come from all over the world . Pope Francis said Sunday that he would hold a meeting of cardinals on February 14 &quot; during which I will name 15 new Cardinals who , coming from 13 countries from every continent , manifest the indissoluble links between the Church of Rome and the particular Churches present in the world , &quot; according to Vatican Radio . New cardinals are always important because they set the tone in the church and also elect the next pope , CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John L. Allen said . The new cardinals come from countries such as Ethiopia , New Zealand and Myanmar . &quot; You &apos;re talking about cardinals from typically overlooked places , like Cape Verde , the Pacific island of Tonga , Panama , Thailand , Uruguay . &quot; . &quot; Francis &apos; pattern is very clear : He wants to go to the geographical peripheries rather than places that are already top-heavy with cardinals , &quot; Allen said . Christopher Bellitto , a professor of church history at Kean University in New Jersey , noted that Francis announced his new slate of cardinals on the Catholic Feast of the Epiphany , which commemorates the visit of the Magi to Jesus &apos; birthplace in Bethlehem . That doesn &apos;t mean Francis is the first pontiff to appoint cardinals from the developing world , though . Beginning in the 1920s , an increasing number of Latin American churchmen were named cardinals , and in the 1960s , St. John XXIII , whom Francis canonized last year , appointed the first cardinals from Japan , the Philippines and Africa . In addition to the 15 new cardinals Francis named on Sunday , five retired archbishops and bishops will also be honored as cardinals . Last year , Pope Francis appointed 19 new cardinals , including bishops from Haiti and Burkina Faso .
HAMILTON , Bermuda ( CNN ) -- Four Chinese nationals of Uyghur ethnicity who had been held at the U.S. military &apos;s Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , detention facility have been resettled in Bermuda , officials said Thursday . &quot; Above all , this was a humanitarian act , &quot; Bermudan Premier Ewart Brown told CNN in an interview at his Cabinet office in Hamilton , Bermuda . They were among 17 Uyghur detainees at the facility set up to hold terror suspects . President Obama has pledged to close the Guantanamo facility , raising questions of what will happen to the more than 200 remaining detainees . A political backlash against bringing any of the detainees to the United States has increased the focus on sending them to other countries . Brown said he read an article on the issue of the Guantanamo Bay detainees &apos; fates in The Washington Post while he was in Washington for a White House meeting in May . Watch concerns about resettling the Uyghur detainees » . They left China because they did not agree with the government , she told CNN . The Chinese statement followed an offer by Palau , a Pacific island nation , to accept the Uyghur detainees . A senior U.S. administration official told CNN the State Department is working on a final agreement with Palau to settle the matter of the 13 remaining Uyghur detainees . The United States will not send Uyghur detainees cleared for release back to China out of concern that they would be tortured by Chinese authorities . Palau said it will take in the ethnic Uyghur detainees for humanitarian reasons and because of the &quot; special relationship &quot; between Palau and the United States . In 2006 , five other Uyghur detainees were transferred to Albania , according to the Justice Department , which said it has no reports they took part in any post-resettlement criminal behavior or terrorist activities .
Kathmandu , Nepal ( CNN ) -- A ferocious leopard may have killed 15 people in Nepal in a 15-month span , its latest victim a 4-year-old boy that the creature dragged away into the jungle to eat . The grisly discovery , which came after teams of people searched for the child , marks the 15th victim in the past 15 months in that remote district in western Nepal . The police chief suspects that a single man-eating leopard is responsible for the deaths . Maheshwor Dhakal , an ecologist at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation in Kathmandu , agreed that it is unusual to find more than one or two man-eating animals in one area . Kharel said he feared the actual number of people killed by the leopard could be higher than 15 , because others have lost their life to leopard attacks in Uttarkhand state in northern India , which borders Baitadi district . &quot; It could be the same leopard , &quot; he said . Of the 15 victims in Nepal so far , two-thirds are children below the age of 10 . The others are older children and a 29-year-old woman who had gone to collect fodder for domestic animals in the nearby forest , a common practice in Nepal . After killing its victim , the leopard takes the body away into the forest to eat . 25,000 ( about $ 300 ) reward to anyone who captures or kills the leopard . Controlling this particular leopard has been a challenge for the wildlife officials in Kathmandu . &quot; There is no alternative but to kill the leopard . &quot; . The chief district administrator has granted permission for this particular leopard to be killed . While cases of leopards killing domestic animals are common , and there are sometimes instances of leopards killing people in Nepal , this case is &quot; extreme , &quot; Dhakal said .
( CNN ) -- Kyle White now has two pieces of metal to wear -- one , a bracelet inscribed with the names of his six comrades killed in an ambush in Afghanistan , the other , a Medal of Honor given to him for his valor that ensured that death toll wasn &apos;t higher . Speaking minutes after President Barack Obama gave him the highest military honor , White insisted the two emblems are equally significant . The former Army sergeant said Tuesday he owes it to these men , whom he calls &quot; my heroes , &quot; to live his life well , even now that he &apos;s left the military , and with honor . &quot; Kyle , members of Chosen Company , you did your duty , &quot; Obama said . White himself insisted that the Medal of Honor cannot really be an individual award , calling it &quot; a testament to the trust we have in each other and our leaders . &quot; . White administered first aid to one wounded soldier using the only cover available : a single tree . A soldier , changed . Obama called him on February 10 to tell him he &apos;d be given the Medal of Honor . Four service members received the Medal of Honor -- all posthumously -- for actions in the war in Iraq , according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society . In a brief statement to reporters after Tuesday &apos;s ceremony , White called the Medal of Honor &quot; a symbol of the responsibility all soldiers knowingly face when they depart for distant lands in defense of the nation , a responsibility that locks us all in the bonds of brotherhood . &quot; . &quot; Without the team , &quot; he said , &quot; there could be no Medal of Honor . That is why I wear this medal for my team . &quot; . 24 minority veterans receive long overdue Medal of Honor . See Kyle White &apos;s Army profile .
At the 2012 International Consumer Electronics Show , computer makers will be pushing a new breed of ultra-thin , ultra-light laptops amid a sea of razor-thin smartphones and tablets . Electronics makers use CES as a platform to show the types of products they plan to release in the coming year . Apple , the world &apos;s most valuable technology company , and Amazon , an upstart in tablets and the leader in e-readers , do not participate . Google &apos;s operating systems can be found in partners &apos; booths , running on phones , tablets and TVs , but the software giant does not run a booth . &quot; a Microsoft spokesman asked rhetorically in a statement . Tablets . Electronics makers have been chasing after Apple &apos;s iPad for two years , and the racetrack is expected to get more crowded next week . At CES , tech companies will showcase plenty of phones with that software , but the touchscreen tablets with Android 4 will be prevalent . Not to get left out of the party it started about a decade ago , Microsoft is stepping up its tablet efforts . Analysts expect to see a bevy of Windows 8 tablets at CES . Sorry , Microsoft . ) . Windows won &apos;t be just for tablets , of course . Microsoft will enable this anti-disc computer with the application store in Windows 8 . &quot; And then you &apos;ve got Microsoft pushing the touchscreen tablet experience . &quot; . That &apos;s a bad sign for Google , whose Chromebooks have struggled to challenge Microsoft in PC operating systems . Internet TVs that also do 3-D . TVs have long been the centerpiece of CES and of the consumer electronics industry as a whole . &quot; These companies see the car as a software platform , &quot; Westergren said . Many electronics makers have apparently decided that each new phone , tablet , car or refrigerator should allow owners to update their Facebook statuses .
( CNN ) -- Bayern Munich might be licking their wounds after defeat in the European Champions League final , but the German club can find comfort in victory of a different kind : by beating Chelsea in football &apos;s financial league table . According to a new report by independent consultancy Brand Finance , which has compiled a list of the 50 biggest brands in the sport , the four-time European champions have been valued at $ 786 million . &quot; Manchester United have got a global reach , &quot; Brand Finance &apos;s head of sports brands Dave Chattaway told CNN . Click here to see football &apos;s top 10 brands . But Bayern are the year &apos;s big winners . Despite the defeat by Chelsea and having been beaten to the German league and cup by Borussia Dortmund , the club &apos;s brand value grew by 59 % over the last 12 months . &quot; Bayern have long-term deals , they have been with Adidas for over 10 years . Behind United and Bayern are the Spanish &quot; El Clasico &quot; rivals of Real Madrid , third with a value of $ 600 million , and Barcelona , with a brand worth $ 580 million . Italian Cup winners Napoli ( $ 85 million ) were the only Serie A club to increase brand value , coming off the back of a relatively successful Champions League campaign , to be 22nd overall . With such a huge gap between the sport &apos;s most lucrative brands and those with less commercial appeal , are football clubs making the most of their financial potential ? . &quot; I think there is more scope for all the clubs to further maximize value -- clubs have traditionally been slow and unimaginative in monetizing the brand they own , &quot; Chattaway said . &quot; The clubs need to better understand the brand asset that they own so that they can ensure they get the right returns on all commercial deals . &quot; .

Tripoli , Libya ( CNN ) -- Rebels in Tripoli furiously hunting for signs of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi are exploring a network of tunnels and bunkers built beneath his massive compound . CNN &apos;s Sara Sidner got a peek at the passageways Friday . The correspondent , who &apos;s been covering the battle of Tripoli , walked down steps into a pitch-dark tunnel and used a flashlight to navigate an underworld described as &quot; massive . &quot; . So far , she said , rebels have cleared about 700 meters of underground passages . The tunnel network is believed to extend all the way to the city &apos;s international airport and the Rixos hotel . That &apos;s where 33 journalists and two foreign nationals were held for five days by pro-Gadhafi forces . It also is thought to extend to a neighborhood where Gadhafi forces were lobbing shells recently toward the compound after it was taken over by the rebels . The tunnels Sidner saw are wide enough for adults to walk side by side . Sidner also saw a range of other sights as she strolled through the labyrinth : A thick wall , a massive door and a sturdy lock .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney on Sunday defended the Bush administration &apos;s economic record , the invasion of Iraq and the treatment of suspected terrorists , warning that reversing its anti-terrorism policies endangers Americans . &quot; We &apos;ve accomplished nearly everything we set out to do , &quot; ex-Vice President Dick Cheney says Sunday about Iraq . Cheney said the administration appears to be returning to the pre-2001 model of treating terrorism as a law enforcement issue , rather than a military problem . But Cheney said he and Bush had to spend money to deal with the September 11 , 2001 attacks , the resulting war in Afghanistan , the disaster of 2005 &apos;s Hurricane Katrina , and the costly and unpopular war in Iraq , now nearly six years old . &quot; All of these things required us to spend money that we had not originally planned to spend , or weren &apos;t originally part of the budget , &quot; Cheney said . But Cheney said the United States has &quot; accomplished nearly everything we set out to do &quot; in Iraq , including establishing a democratic government in the Middle East . Cheney was one of the administration &apos;s leading advocates of the 2003 invasion of Iraq , pressing the Bush administration &apos;s argument that Iraq was concealing weapons of mass destruction and could provide those weapons to terrorists . None of those weapons were found after the invasion , but Cheney said , &quot; We &apos;ve eliminated that possibility . &quot; . &quot; I don &apos;t hear much talk about that , but the fact is , the violence level is down 90 percent , &quot; Cheney said . Though considered one of the administration &apos;s most influential figures , Cheney said President Bush rebuffed his advice on at least two issues . Watch Cheney tout Bush administration » . And Cheney said he argued against the administration &apos;s policy on North Korea , which tested a nuclear weapon in 2006 . &quot; I had my say , &quot; Cheney told CNN .
Washington ( CNN ) -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a full mental competency screening for Omar Gonzalez , who is accused of jumping the White House fence , after a disputed initial examination found him not competent for trial . U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer expressed concern that the initial mental exam , ordered by a magistrate judge , was done before she had a chance to hear a legal motion by the defense disputing whether the magistrate had the authority to order it . David Bos , the federal public defender representing Gonzalez , objected to any examination in the first place because he says Gonzalez is fit for trial . The 60-minute initial mental examination of Gonzalez at the District of Columbia jail came as a surprise to the judge and to both the government and defense . But the result , finding Gonzalez not competent , can &apos;t be ignored , Collyer said in court Tuesday . Bos told the judge : &quot; There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Gonzalez is competent to stand trial . &quot; The judge delayed arraignment for Gonzalez on new charges the government filed against him last week . Gonzalez was arrested in September after he allegedly jumped the White House fence and sprinted into the executive mansion , setting off concerns about Secret Service security procedures . His family has said Gonzalez , an Iraq War veteran , suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoia . Collyer said that during the initial examination , the mental health screener found Gonzalez did understand some parts of the proceedings . The judge suggested that Gonzalez &apos;s mental issues , which she didn &apos;t describe more fully , could be resolved with medication . The judge also raised concerns that the government &apos;s handling of previous unrelated cases could mean it will take some time for Gonzalez to be examined at a federal Bureau of Prisons facility .

( CNN ) -- Criminals who file fraudulent tax returns by stealing people &apos;s identities could rake in an estimated $ 26 billion over the next five years because the IRS cannot keep up with the amount of the fraud , Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George said Tuesday . &quot; The estimate was based on 2010 figures , which took place before the IRS instituted major changes with the way it handles identity theft cases , &quot; the IRS statement read . Last year , according to the Treasury Inspector General &apos;s Office , the IRS reported that of the 2.2 million tax returns it found to be fraudulent , about 940,000 returns totaling $ 6.5 billion were related to identity theft . The IRS will only select those tax returns that it can verify based on its resources . &quot; . &quot; When the identity thief files the fraudulent tax return , the IRS does not yet know that the individual &apos;s identity will be used more than once , &quot; George said . As of last month , the IRS reported that it had stopped the issuance of $ 1.3 billion in potentially fraudulent tax returns . The IRS says it determined these returns were potentially fraudulent through a sampling of returns , and it does not believe any legitimate returns were included . &quot; The IRS acknowledges that it does not know the exact number of identity theft incidents or the number of taxpayers affected by identity theft , &quot; George said . The IRS maintains it has certain filters in place at the start of the tax filing season to prevent and detect identity theft and fraud , and it says it has recently trained additional employees across the country to deal with the problem . In the past four years , he said , the IRS has identified more than 490,000 taxpayers who are the victims of identity theft .
( CNN ) -- A short video that has gone viral in Mexico asks a tough question of the country &apos;s presidential candidates : &quot; Are you striving only for the ( presidential ) chair , or will you change the future of our country ? &quot; . But the list of Mexico &apos;s woes weighs heavily : security , pollution and poverty , among others . &quot; In reality , the video is not reflecting anything that people have not experienced , &quot; said Rosenda Martinez , a spokeswoman for Our Mexico of the Future , the group behind the production . The video targets the major presidential candidates -- Enrique Pena Nieto , Josefina Vazquez Mota and Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador -- and aims to raise awareness about Our Mexico of the Future .

So far , more than 10 million Mexicans have written or recorded their dreams for a safer or cleaner or more tolerant Mexico . &quot; We &apos;ve had the response we &apos;ve hoped for , and even exceeded it , &quot; Martinez said . Stop working for your party , and not for us . Some of the candidates have watched the video . Vazquez Mota , of the ruling National Action Party , said the video &apos;s message can &apos;t go unnoticed , while Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate Pena Nieto expressed that now is the time for change , as the video suggests . Leftist candidate Lopez Obrador , of the Party of the Democratic Revolution , had not seen the video , but said he agreed with the theme of change . Our Mexico of the Future will release data based on the millions of messages it has received . Martinez said to expect that security and the environment are the two most popular themes mentioned by Mexicans . CNN &apos;s Krupskaia Alis contributed to this report from Mexico City .

( Health.com ) -- An essential nutrient found in fish oil does not appear to slow the mental decline associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association . ( The other main ingredient found in fish oil , eicosapentaenoic acid , or EPA , is not believed to play a significant role in brain health . ) . Health.com : Fish oil doesn &apos;t benefit new moms , babies . DHA or fish-oil supplements aren &apos;t likely to cause any harm to Alzheimer &apos;s patients , but they aren &apos;t likely to do any good either , says Steven H. Ferris , Ph.D. , the director of the Aging and Dementia Research Center at New York University . Fish oil &quot; seems to be healthy in general , and maybe for other things it &apos;s helpful , but it doesn &apos;t benefit cognitive function in a person with Alzheimer &apos;s , &quot; says Ferris , who was not involved in the study . Several studies that followed large groups of people as they aged have suggested that a diet rich in fish is linked to a reduced risk of dementia and mental decline , but most randomized controlled trials comparing DHA supplements with placebo have found no benefit . Quinn and his colleagues randomly assigned about 400 women and men in their mid-70s with likely Alzheimer &apos;s disease -- the disease is very difficult to accurately diagnose -- to take 2 grams of DHA or placebo capsules per day . Health.com : 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer &apos;s disease . Treatments such as DHA may be too little too late for people who are already showing signs of Alzheimer &apos;s , according to Dr. Kristine Yaffe , M.D. , a professor of psychiatry at the University of California , San Francisco . &quot; Effective treatment strategies to prevent progression of &#91; Alzheimer &apos;s disease &#93; will likely need to be initiated earlier , &quot; Yaffe writes in an editorial accompanying the study .

Ballet dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko , often cast as the villain in Bolshoi Ballet productions , is now the lead defendant in a plot worthy of a Tchaikovsky score . The mystery of who threw sulfuric acid into Filin &apos;s face in January has captivated Russians and kept Moscow detectives busy probing rivalries within Russia &apos;s renowned 240-year-old ballet company . Russian police question suspect in Bolshoi director &apos;s acid attack . Two alleged co-conspirators have been detained : Alleged hit man Yuri Zarutsky -- a burly , bearded Russian who was previously convicted of beating someone to death -- and Andrey Lipatov , who allegedly drove the getaway car after Zarutksy &apos;s battery acid attack on Filin . While the final act must still play out in a Russian courtroom , the story opens in the nearly two-century-old Bolshoi Theatre . Act 1 - The Bolshoi Theatre . Ballet is a world where competition is fierce , and where the artistic director wields considerable influence in making or breaking careers . Filin , 42 , was promoted to the Bolshoi Theatre &apos;s coveted post in March 2011 , shortly after the deputy ballet director , Gennady Yanin , who was widely seen as a favorite for the artistic director post , resigned when pornographic pictures of him surfaced online . That year , two dancers quit , unhappy with the direction the ballet had taken . Another dancer , Nikolai Tsiskaridze , loudly criticized Filin for going over budget in the ballet &apos;s multimllion-dollar renovation . Act 2 - The Streets of Moscow . The trio of conspirators obtained battery acid at a car parts store , and made the acid stronger by evaporating the water from it , police said . As Filin entered the security code at the door of his Moscow apartment , authorities say , Zarutsky confronted him and tossed the sulfuric acid into his face . Act 3 - Moscow Police Headquarters . Act 4 - A Moscow Court .
This week the Supreme Court heard two historic cases on marriage . United States v. Windsor asks whether Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act , which defines marriage for federal law and programs as between one man and one woman , is unconstitutional . In Windsor , the defendant was the federal government . Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts . There &apos;s a second issue in Windsor . Edith Windsor entered into a gay marriage in Canada in 2007 and lived in New York . When her partner died in 2009 , Windsor sued to contest the federal estate tax she paid , claiming a spousal exemption . But New York did not create gay marriage until 2011 , so Windsor was not harmed by DOMA not allowing the federal government to recognize her marriage , since if the IRS used state definitions Windsor would still be regarded an a single woman . He openly expressed skepticism in Hollingsworth and led the Court in an hour-long debate in Windsor solely focused on whether the court has jurisdiction . Windsor would alter America &apos;s system of federalism . If Windsor is historic , Hollingsworth is earth-shattering . If the Supreme Court declares a constitutional right to marriage other than one-man , one-woman , then all traditional marriage laws in all 50 states will be invalid , and there will be a serious debate ( already in a lower federal court ) of whether polygamists also have a constitutional right to national recognition . On the merits , the court seems unlikely to declare an unwritten constitutional right to gay marriage , though arguments did not go as well for DOMA . It is an energetic debate in all 50 states , and this summer we will learn whether the Supreme Court will shut down this debate by making it a constitutional issue on which the American people are not allowed to vote .
These men are part of the country &apos;s Ebola response team , specifically tasked with burying anyone suspected to have died of the Ebola virus . The virus is spread through contact with the blood and body fluids of people infected with Ebola , and it is still transferable even from a dead body . Now almost anytime there is a suspected Ebola death in the community , they call in the Ebola response team to come and bury the body safely . &quot; When it started , it wasn &apos;t that easy , &quot; says Alpha Tamba , an Ebola response coordinator in Lofa County . Kazalee Johnson , a community worker , tells CNN the empty houses belong to people who either died of Ebola or those who fled in terror , for fear of contracting the virus . But then there &apos;s Barkedu Town -- of the 1,000 or so Ebola-related deaths in Liberia , 20 % of the victims have died in this single town . &quot; From the time we started receiving death from Ebola -- every activity cease , &quot; says Musa Sessay , the town &apos;s chief . And not even the health workers are spared the ravaging effects of Ebola . Ebola nightmares . &quot; Sometimes we go to bed and we dream of nothing else but Ebola , Ebola , Ebola -- nothing else , &quot; he explains . &quot; It is difficult to stand in front of Ebola , but this is the situation we have , &quot; he says . &quot; We must do everything we can to kick Ebola out of our country . &quot; Staying at home or running away from Ebola is not a solution , so we have to face it .

( CNN ) -- The big winners of this Formula One season could be road drivers rather than F1 racers , according to one former world champion . Jody Scheckter , who took the drivers &apos; title in 1979 , hopes a raft of technological changes -- notably smaller , hybrid engines that promise greater fuel efficiency -- will help improve road cars &apos; performance . This year &apos;s race cars will boast an enhanced Energy Recovery System ( ERS ) and 1.6-liter V6 engines , compared to the 2.4-liter V8s on show last year . The Kinetic Energy Recovery System ( KERS ) has been used in F1 since 2009 , but Scheckter says these latest advancements in the sport will only benefit everyday drivers . &quot; Wherever there is heat , they turn that into energy , &quot; added the former Ferrari driver . &quot; From that point of view , that &apos;s what road cars are becoming more and more . &quot; They &apos;ve taken this energy from the brakes and these different areas , that &apos;s what Formula One has done to a much higher degree than I &apos;ve ever seen before . I think the technology will flow to road cars very quickly . &quot; It &apos;s very important for the global environment that they can make the technology work practically and then it can move into road cars . &quot; . On the track , Scheckter expects an unpredictable start to the championship as teams and drivers wrestle with the new regulations . Hamilton , a world champion in 2008 , set the fastest time on the final day of the final test event in Bahrain , but the quickest lap time of preseason was set by Felipe Massa of Williams . &quot; I would &apos;ve thought after the fourth , fifth race , you might see things settle down . &quot; What they are trying to do is make it so the last race determines the championship , &quot; he said .

( CNN ) -- European football &apos;s governing body , UEFA has revealed that 32 of its 54 member states have declared an interest in hosting matches at the 2020 European Championships . Traditionally , the tournament is hosted by one or two nations , but matches in 2020 will be shared between 13 cities across Europe . UEFA , who announced a change in format for the tournament &apos;s 60th anniversary last December , welcomed the enthusiastic response from the national football associations . &quot; We are extremely proud to see the huge interest in the bidding process , with more than half of our member associations willing to host matches at UEFA EURO 2020 , &quot; UEFA President Michel Platini said . Platini initially floated the idea following the 2012 championships hosted by Poland and Ukraine and a decision to change the format was agreed by UEFA &apos;s Executive Committee last December before being confirmed in January . The format , dubbed a &quot; Euro for Europe , &quot; has attracted interest from reigning Euro champions , Spain and the other traditional powerhouses of European football -- Germany , France , Italy , Netherlands , Portugal , Greece and England . &quot; UEFA &apos;s &apos; EURO for Europe &apos; in 2020 promises to be a fitting way to recognise 60 years of the UEFA European Championship , &quot; said England Football Association secretary Alex Horne in a statement . UEFA says all 32 associations can submit a maximum of two bids -- one which covers three group matches and one knockout round and another which will vie to host the semifinal and final . The closing date for bids is April 25 with UEFA &apos;s Executive Committee announcing the host cities on September 25 next year .
New York ( CNN ) -- Northeast Florida State Attorney Angela Corey has made it clear that she alone will decide whether George Zimmerman will be charged in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin . But the question remains , will George Zimmerman be charged ? . They said they had lost contact with their client over the previous two days and revealed Zimmerman &apos;s unusual behavior -- including phone calls to Fox News host Sean Hannity and the special prosecutor , Corey . Many suspect that the announcement that Zimmerman had gone rogue forced the special prosecutor &apos;s hand . If she files charges against Zimmerman , it would be wise not to &quot; overcharge &quot; the case . To prove manslaughter in Florida , Corey &apos;s team would have to prove that Zimmerman &apos;s acts caused Martin &apos;s death . So even if Zimmerman killed Martin , he was justified in doing so if he believed he was in danger of being killed himself or of suffering great bodily harm . It seems the Sanford Police certainly believed Zimmerman &apos;s claims . Zimmerman left his home to go to Target and was carrying a concealed weapon for which he had a permit . Martin was 17 years old , Zimmerman , 28 . The police report describes Martin as 6 feet tall and 160 pounds and lists Zimmerman as 5-foot-9 . Zimmerman sees Martin , deems him &quot; suspicious &quot; and calls the police . Zimmerman tells the dispatcher he is following Martin . The dispatcher tells Zimmerman &quot; we don &apos;t need you to do that . &quot; Martin notices Zimmerman is following him and tells his girlfriend , Dee Dee , with whom he is on the phone . Zimmerman says that he returns to his parked SUV and is attacked suddenly by Martin . Martin asks Zimmerman why he is following him . Three witnesses saw Zimmerman straddling Martin in the grass . The incident happens 70 yards from the home Martin was walking to , not near Zimmerman &apos;s SUV .
( CNN ) If that car parked in Harvard Yard is a rockin &apos; , school officials may soon come a knockin &apos; , because hanky-panky between students and faculty at the elite university has officially been banned . Specifically , the school adopted a new policy this week that prohibits romantic relationships between undergraduates and professors . The previous policy only did so between professors and the students they taught . Harvard released a statement saying a specially appointed committee &quot; determined that the existing language on relationships of unequal status did not explicitly reflect the faculty &apos;s expectations of what constituted an appropriate relationship between undergraduate students and faculty members ... therefore , the committee revised the policy to include a clear prohibition to better accord with these expectations . &quot; . The action comes nearly a year after the U.S. Department of Education announced it was investigating 55 colleges and universities , including Harvard , for violations pertaining to Title IX , the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination on college campuses . Harvard responded at the time by saying it had appointed its first ever Title IX officer , and that the school &apos;s president &quot; recently announced the creation of a university-wide task force -- composed of faculty , students and staff -- that will recommend how we can better prevent sexual misconduct at Harvard . &quot; . The new policy is the result of &quot; a formal process to review Harvard University &apos;s Title IX policy , &quot; the school said .
That &apos;s all it takes for the flamboyantly dressed jockeys of Italy &apos;s legendary horse race -- Palio di Siena -- to race bareback around the medieval square . Now as the dust settles on this year &apos;s colorful Palio di Siena , CNN takes a look at five weird and wonderful horse festivals from across the world . Palio di Siena , Italy . On two days each year , the pretty town of Siena in northern Tuscany is transformed into an elaborate medieval race track , with 10 riders careering around the iconic city square three times .

Horse are ridden over blazing tree branches as part of the Luminaries Festival in San Bartolome de Pinares , in an effort to purify and protect the animals . From fiery Spain to snowy Switzerland -- there &apos;s not a bonfire in sight at the glitzy White Turf racing carnival , held on the frozen Lake St Moritz . Pasola Festival , Indonesia . The glitz and glam of snow-capped St Moritz couldn &apos;t be further from the spear-wielding horsemen of Indonesia &apos;s annual Pasola Festival . The fierce festival -- held on the island of Sumba -- sees two teams go head-to-head on elaborately decorated horses , throwing blunt spears at each other as part of an ancient ritual battle . Soma-Nomaoi Festival , Japan . If you like your ancient festivals a little less violent , there &apos;s the 1,000-year-old Soma-Nomaoi wild horse chase in central Japan .

( CNN ) -- Sergio Garcia , a 36-year-old undocumented immigrant in California , has held two lifelong dreams : to become a U.S. citizen and to practice law . Garcia can be admitted to California &apos;s state bar and legally practice as a lawyer there , the court ruled . &quot; I &apos;m super excited to finally be able to fulfill one of my dreams , &quot; Garcia told CNN Friday . But the case raises many questions , particularly among those who have been critical of Garcia &apos;s efforts to practice law . Garcia says that this an easy initial response to make but that looking at the details of his case , it is not so clear-cut . If anyone feels frustrated the the situation , they should address it with the federal government , Garcia said . Garcia was born in Mexico in 1977 and taken to California by his parents when he was 17 months old , according to court documents . Eight years later , at age 17 , Garcia again returned to California with his parents and without documentation , though his father had obtained permanent resident status in the United States . That year , Garcia &apos;s father filed an immigration visa petition on his son &apos;s behalf , which federal immigration officials accepted in 1995 . The visa still has not been granted , even though Garcia has lived in the state since 1994 . California &apos;s Supreme Court ruled Thursday ( PDF ) that no state law or public policy should stop Garcia or others like him from obtaining a law license in the state . Asked why he didn &apos;t choose a different career or pursue other opportunities , Garcia said law was his singular focus . &quot; That , and I &apos;m a little bit stubborn , anyway , &quot; Garcia added . Now that he has a law license , however , one thing that Garcia will not specialize in is immigration law .
( CNN ) James Best , best known for his portrayal of bumbling sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane on TV &apos;s &quot; The Dukes of Hazzard , &quot; died Monday after a brief illness . Although he &apos;d been a busy actor for decades in theater and in Hollywood , Best didn &apos;t become famous until 1979 , when &quot; The Dukes of Hazzard &apos;s &quot; cornpone charms began beaming into millions of American homes almost every Friday night . Among the most popular shows on TV in the early &apos; 80s , &quot; The Dukes of Hazzard &quot; ran until 1985 and spawned TV movies , an animated series and video games . Several of Best &apos;s &quot; Hazzard &quot; co-stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media . &quot; I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year , &quot; co-star John Schneider , who played Bo Duke , said on Twitter . &quot; Every minute of his long life was spent acting , writing , producing , painting , teaching , fishing , or involved in another of his life &apos;s many passions . &quot; . Born Jewel Guy on July 26 , 1926 , in Powderly , Kentucky , Best was orphaned at 3 and adopted by Armen and Essa Best , who renamed him James and raised him in rural Indiana . Best served in the Army during World War II before launching his acting career . In the 1950s and 1960s , he accumulated scores of credits , playing a range of colorful supporting characters in such TV shows as &quot; The Twilight Zone , &quot; &quot; Bonanza , &quot; &quot; The Andy Griffith Show &quot; and &quot; Gunsmoke . &quot; He later appeared in a handful of Burt Reynolds &apos; movies , including &quot; Hooper &quot; and &quot; The End . &quot; . &quot; I directed two of his feature films , including the recent &apos; Return of the Killer Shrews , &apos; a sequel he co-wrote and was quite proud of as he had made the first one more than 50 years earlier . &quot; .

As a 20-year-old , Ana Ivanovic claimed the French Open on Roland Garros &apos; clay courts . Since that win in Paris in 2008 , Ivanovic has suffered from big-match nerves , serving woes and a series of injury problems . &quot; I &apos;ve been working really hard , &quot; Ivanovic told retired grand slam champion Kim Clijsters in an interview for CNN &apos;s Open Court show . Her desire to follow up that 2008 French Open win has also led Ivanovic to ponder why she picked up a racket at the age of five in the first place -- for the enjoyment . In Kontic , Ivanovic may not have a wise professor on her hands as she did with Sears , yet the 32-year-old , ranked 1,635th in men &apos;s doubles , is able to offer her something that respect within the game cannot always buy -- a shared cultural identity . &quot; I &apos;m really enjoying someone who speaks the same language and can understand you , &quot; Ivanovic said . Employing a coaching team made up of her compatriots could be key to Ivanovic performing consistently , according to a former grand slam champion turned coach . Ivanovic &apos;s solitary grand slam win helped the baseliner become the world No . Wrist , shoulder , foot , abdominal and hip injuries all took their toll as Ivanovic fell to No . While her playing fortunes might have fluctuated , Ivanovic &apos;s marketability has never been dented . Despite Ivanovic &apos;s obvious talent , Durie doubts whether her game has the consistency required to win a grand slam . &quot; She can beat the top players , but to win a grand slam you have to win seven matches . Ivanovic , now 26 , admitted that she too has started thinking about life after tennis .
New York ( CNN ) -- A federal judge has ordered that an official monitor be put in place to prevent discrimination in the hiring of New York City firefighters . U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis said the city needs &quot; to comprehensively reassess its policies and practices , to analyze the evidence showing the effect of those policies and practices , and to rationally consider how they can be changed to achieve a firefighter hiring process that is -- in actual practice and effect -- fair and open to all . &quot; . The order requires the city to take remedial steps to fix discriminatory hiring practices and puts the court monitor in place for at least the next 10 years to make sure those steps are taken . Garaufis cited &quot; the clear evidence of disparate impact that Mayor ( Michael ) Bloomberg and his senior leadership chose to ignore was obvious to anyone else who looked . &quot; . &quot; Instead of facing hard facts and asking hard questions about the City &apos;s abysmal track record of hiring black and Hispanic firefighters , the Bloomberg Administration dug in and fought back , &quot; the judge said in his ruling . Litigation against the city &apos;s firefighter hiring practices began in 2007 , when the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint alleging the Fire Department of New York &apos;s hiring exams negatively affected black and Hispanic applicants . Bloomberg strongly disagreed with the decision . Bloomberg said 61,000 people , more than half of them minorities , applied to the fire department in the last recruiting campaign , &quot; shattering any previous record for minority applicants . &quot; . Garaufis acknowledged that the city has improved its minority recruiting , but he said the subsequent hiring processes and &quot; discriminatory testing procedures &quot; have kept many of these minorities from actually being hired .
The sickening execution , recorded and released online for the world to see , came with a warning to the U.S. : ISIS showed another captive American journalist , believed to be Steven Sotloff , and threatened to kill him too if the U.S. does not stop helping those fighting to stop ISIS advances . The killing and the threat , along with all the evidence ISIS is leaving as it gouges its way across the region , are a direct challenge to the American people , to the U.S. government and to the international community . First , obviously , it cannot give into ISIS threats and must continue helping dislodge ISIS from northern Iraq where it is engaging in ethnic cleansing against Christians and other minorities ; kidnapping , raping and selling women ; and massacring people . There are few people on Earth who are not horrified by ISIS . ISIS is the enemy of anyone who does not belong to ISIS . Any country that disagrees , any government that is not revolted by ISIS and troubled by its methods and its goals , should go on record saying so . When ISIS calls itself a state , it is not hyperbole by very much . There have been reports of hundreds , even thousands , of Europeans training , fighting and killing alongside ISIS . Graduates of the Syria war , from where ISIS pushed into Iraq , have killed in Europe . And ISIS ideology is gaining support in the continent . ISIS can simply not be allowed to keep a foothold in the Middle East . It is politically and strategically complicated , because ISIS is also fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah , and defeating ISIS would also be enormously pleasing to Iran . That suffering has now extended to Iraq , and it will only become more widespread if ISIS is not stopped .
Qena , Egypt ( CNN ) -- In a deserted playground a few hundred miles south of Cairo , 13-year-old Asmaa Ashraf fiddles with a broken rusted slide . And as the government struggles to wade through the country &apos;s protracted political problems , Egypt &apos;s festering education system is orphaned -- even though , with a growing youth population , it &apos;s key to the country &apos;s future . In the World Economic Forum &apos;s latest report on global competitiveness , Egypt ranked near the bottom -- 131st out of 144 countries -- for quality of primary education . Egypt &apos;s literacy rate is 66 % , according to a 2011 United Nations report . The situation is worst in regions far from the capital , and in Upper Egypt , where more than half the population is under 29 . To make up for the gaps in education , millions of middle-class Egyptian families spend a large part of their income -- sometimes as much as 25 % -- on private tutoring . Egypt &apos;s final secondary school exams are a rite of passage for students . The status quo is even more somber for Egypt &apos;s women . According to a recent World Bank report , the illiteracy rate for young people in Upper Egypt is 17 % , higher than the national average of 11 % , and the illiteracy rates for females is 24 % , almost twice that of males . Also , 70 % of young women in Upper Egypt are jobless . But with unemployment at staggering rates -- 33 % for men age 20-24 and 53 % for women in the same age -- Egypt has a highly combustible pool of frustrated and disenfranchised youth in danger of becoming a lost generation . However , as Egypt &apos;s public education system founders , a few innovative ideas have emerged . Another innovative initiative is Teach for Egypt , a start-up created by Nada Ramadan , a 24-year-old Egyptian who &apos;s a graduate student at Georgetown University in Washington .
A U.S. Air Force spy plane evaded an encounter with the Russian military on July 18 , just a day after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed by a suspected surface-to-air missile that Ukraine and the West allege was fired by pro-Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine . The RC-135 Rivet Joint fled into nearby Swedish airspace without that country &apos;s permission , a U.S. military official told CNN . The U.S. plane had been flying in international airspace , conducting an electronic eavesdropping mission on the Russian military , when the Russians took the unusual action of beginning to track it with land-based radar . The Russians then sent at least one fighter jet into the sky to intercept the aircraft , the U.S. official said Saturday . The quickest route away from the Russians took them into Swedish airspace . The U.S. official acknowledged that was done without Swedish military approval . &quot; We acknowledge a U.S. aircraft veered into Swedish airspace and will take active steps to ensure we have properly communicated with Swedish authorities in advance to prevent similar issues before they arise , &quot; the U.S. State Department said . The incident was first reported by the Swedish news agency Svenska Dagbladet . This was at least the second potentially-dangerous encounter between a U.S. plane and Russia over the past few months . On April 23 , a Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet buzzed within 100 feet of the nose of a U.S. Air Force RC-135U reconnaissance plane over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan , a Defense Department official said . Russian fighter jet nearly collided with U.S. military plane in April . Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other , both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska . But the official said the land radar activity by the Russians in this instance was unusual .
( CNN ) The attorney for a suburban New York cardiologist charged in what authorities say was a failed scheme to have another physician hurt or killed is calling the allegations against his client &quot; completely unsubstantiated . &quot; . Appearing Saturday morning on CNN &apos;s &quot; New Day , &quot; Randy Zelin defended his client , Dr. Anthony Moschetto , who faces criminal solicitation , conspiracy , burglary , arson , criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island . &quot; He &apos;s got patients to see . They pleaded not guilty in Nassau County District Court , according to authorities . Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf , according to prosecutors . During the course of the undercover operation , however , Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition , prosecutors said . Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to &quot; blow up a building . &quot; He later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead . Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson , according to prosecutors . &quot; The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute , &quot; according to the statement from the district attorney &apos;s office . Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist , according to prosecutors . &quot; He was willing to pay $ 5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months , and then he said he would pay $ 20,000 to have him killed , &quot; said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly , according to CNN affiliate WCBS .
( CNN ) -- Activists speaking at a Syrian government-sponsored &quot; national dialogue &quot; meeting Sunday criticized recent crackdowns by the country &apos;s security forces , calling for an end to violence against protesters . The Syrian government has claimed armed groups are responsible for the violence at the demonstrations . Syrian researcher Al-Tayyeb Tizzina also criticized the use of force and asked for violence to stop in order for the dialogue to succeed . Al-Shara acknowledged that a surge of violence in Syria precipitated Sunday &apos;s meeting . The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said the meeting included members of the opposition , independent activists , youth leaders and academics . Ambassador Robert Ford was not summoned by Syrian officials on Sunday ; his meeting with Syria &apos;s foreign minister was previously scheduled by the U.S. Embassy in Damascus last Thursday . He also accused the Syrian government of inciting Syrians against the United States , including organizing a protest outside the U.S. Embassy Friday and Saturday , the senior State Department official said . State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland issued a blunt rebuttal to similar Syrian government accusations Friday , calling claims that Ford &apos;s visit was inciting protesters &quot; absolute rubbish &quot; and saying she was &quot; dismayed &quot; by the Syrian government &apos;s reaction . The French government summoned Syria &apos;s ambassador to France on Sunday to issue a formal protest on this matter , and to hold Syrian authorities responsible for the security of French diplomats in the Middle Eastern country . Diplomatic tensions over Syria also flared in Washington last week , with the State Department summoning Syrian Ambassador Imad Mustapha Friday . The State Department said Mustapha was called &quot; to express a number of our concerns with the reported actions of certain Syrian embassy staff in the United States . &quot; .
&quot; The first one on the list was the Zambia space program , &quot; says De Middel who , after a decade of working as a news photojournalist , had decided to embark on a new career as a visual storyteller . In the self-published book , De Middel self-consciously conjures up the story of the unofficial space program piece by piece . Whilst playful , De Middel &apos;s dream-like images are not intended to make fun of Nkoloso &apos;s fantastical , yet high-flying , ambitions . &quot; I think that &apos;s the greatest characteristic we have as humans , that we can dream of becoming big , &quot; says De Middel . Creating The Afronauts , which was sold out in just a few months , De Middel worked more as a movie director , trying to make the best of the resources around her . &quot; It was like a short , small and very modest movie production , &quot; says De Middel . De Middel , who &apos;s never been to Zambia , acknowledges she &apos;s not &quot; an expert in Africa &quot; -- nor in space . &quot; I always kept in my mind that I don &apos;t know a lot about African history and I am approaching a subject that can be sensitive or can be offensive for some people , &quot; says De Middel . She &apos;s been contacted by Nigeria &apos;s space program and been invited to the continent to give talks , while her book is being shown in South Africa and Senegal . If anything , De Middel says , the extraordinary tale of the forgotten Zambian space program presented a chance to talk about Africa from a different perspective . Read this : Zambia &apos;s amazing street acrobats . &quot; Not only because the story is positive , in terms of African people having dreams , but also evidencing what we expect from Africa in terms of aesthetics and behavior . &quot; . &quot; He had a fascination for the universe that we all share , &quot; says De Middel .
( CNN ) -- By now , we &apos;re on the same page that Mitt Romney &apos;s pick of Paul Ryan as his running mate contradicts a golden oldie of presidential election strategy -- run to the conservative ( or liberal ) base to win the nomination and then reposition toward the center to lure the more moderate independent swing voters who are necessary to win the general election . Just the opposite -- Romney has doubled down on his move to the right during the primary battle . Give Romney some credit . Put on your thinking caps and grab an abacus , here are the numbers that could put Romney in the White House . To make sure they harvest the Ryan enthusiasts , the Romney campaign appears to be assembling an impressive operation to turn out the vote and to aggressively compete with the Obama team for the early vote . What makes the Romney mobilization particularly threatening to Obama is that it targets his biggest challenge -- polls consistently show him ahead but there are ominous signs that a decisive group of those supporters won &apos;t actually cast a ballot . This possible weakness in the Democratic coalition coincides with a bit more slippage among Obama &apos;s 2008 supporters ( 9 % ) than among McCain voters who won &apos;t vote GOP in November ( 5 % ) . Bottom line : By picking the bona fide conservative Ryan , the Republican base is likely to deliver a rapturous response , which may allow Romney to succeed in exploiting Obama &apos;s greatest weakness at this point . All in all , Romney has a tough battle ahead -- even stringent counts of Electoral College votes based on polls show Obama within striking distance of winning . But using Ryan to ignite the Republican base is probably Romney &apos;s most plausible path to prevailing .
The case concerns the torture of Ogoni leaders in Nigeria , but at stake is the future of the law under which this case was brought , the Alien Tort Statute . At its best , our nation has played a crucial role in championing human rights throughout the world and pioneering human rights law . Passed in 1789 , the Alien Tort Statute was a prescient piece of legislation . The Supreme Court court accepted Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum last fall after a federal appeals court ruled that the statute could not be used to sue corporations . The justices indicated in February that they might question not just the application of the statute to corporations but whether and under what circumstances it applies to any human rights violations , even by individuals , that take place outside the United States . The case has been brought in the United States because of our nation &apos;s historical role in promoting the idea of universal rights and in the development of international human rights law . On this grim and morally and legally compromised horizon , the Alien Tort Statute is still one bright spot for human rights advocacy . In the wake of the case , Filártiga v. Peña-Irala , the Alien Tort Statute developed into a new tool in human rights law . If the statute is narrowed and its promise of universal accountability curtailed , it will rightly be perceived as yet another step by the U.S. away from its once leading advocacy for human rights . If , on the other hand , the Supreme Court upholds the Alien Tort Statute , it will signal to the world that we do still believe that people everywhere are entitled to certain fundamental rights and that we will help enforce those rights .
Hong Kong ( CNN ) -- Thousands of people filled Hong Kong &apos;s Victoria Park on Saturday to mark the 22nd anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square . The candlelight vigil comes after recent efforts by the Chinese government to quash would-be demonstrators from holding anti-government protests . About 26 people were arrested between February and March , according to a Hong Kong-based human rights group , when an anonymous group began an internet campaign calling for anti-government protests in China similar to ones that have taken hold in the Middle East . In response to the campaign , authorities deployed heavy security along major thoroughfares , especially in Wangfujing , a busy shopping street in downtown Beijing that had been designated by the online group for protests . Saturday &apos;s protest is an annual event organized by the Hong Kong Alliance , a pro-democracy group . Hong Kong police called it a &quot; peaceful gathering . &quot; . A little more than 22 years ago , students gathered in Tiananmen Square to memorialize the recently deceased Hu Yaobang . He was fired as Communist Party chief in 1987 by Deng Xiaoping for pushing policies deemed too soft toward &quot; bourgeois-liberal ideas &quot; and tolerating student protests . The April 15 memorial quickly turned into a pro-democracy movement , and students held talks with the government and later a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square to press their cause . On June 4 , 1989 , Chinese troops in armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled toward Tiananmen Square . The soldiers , on strict orders to clear the square of demonstrators , had forced their way through the city &apos;s main thoroughfare . Relatives of victims renew their hopes every year that Beijing &apos;s leaders will reverse the verdict that the protests were a counter-revolutionary rebellion that had to be put down .

( CNN ) -- As Barack Obama makes his case to the nation for taking the fight to ISIS , his top diplomat is also trying to make sure America doesn &apos;t have to go it alone . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is sweeping through the Middle East to try to convince regional leaders to back America &apos;s plan to beat back the terror group , which has seized a large chunk of territory stretching from northern Syria to central Iraq with alarming pace in recent months .
( CNN ) -- South Korea launched an investigation Tuesday into reports of toxic chemicals being dumped at a former U.S. military base , the Defense Ministry said . ( CNN ) -- South Korea launched an investigation Tuesday into reports of toxic chemicals being dumped at a former U.S. military base , the Defense Ministry said . ( CNN ) -- South Korea launched an investigation Tuesday into reports of toxic chemicals being dumped at a former U.S. military base , the Defense Ministry said . The tests follow allegations of American soldiers burying chemicals on Korean soil . The first tests are being carried out by a joint military , government and civilian task force at the site of what was Camp Mercer , west of Seoul . &quot; Soil and underground water will be taken in the areas where toxic chemicals were allegedly buried , &quot; said the statement from the South Korean Defense Ministry . Once testing is finished , the government will decide on how to test more than 80 other sites -- all former bases . The alarm was raised this month when a U.S. veteran alleged barrels of the toxic herbicide Agent Orange were buried at an American base in South Korea in the late 1970s . Two of his fellow soldiers corroborated his story about Camp Carroll , about 185 miles ( 300 kilometers ) southeast of the capital , Seoul . &quot; We &apos;ve been working very closely with the Korean government since we had the initial claims , &quot; said Lt. Gen. John Johnson , who is heading the Camp Carroll Task Force . A joint U.S.- South Korean investigation is being conducted at Camp Carroll to test the validity of allegations . The U.S. military sprayed Agent Orange from planes onto jungles in Vietnam to kill vegetation in an effort to expose guerrilla fighters .
Some of these &quot; Dreamers &quot; had been deported to Mexico by the Obama administration , though President Obama has repeatedly said that his administration is not looking to deport Dreamers--the name taken by young immigrants who are in the U.S. without papers . Then , on July 22 , all nine linked arms and marched across the border into the United States . The idea was to draw attention to the administration &apos;s repressive immigration policies . Pending those hearings , the nine have now been released into the waiting arms of family members within the United States . Ditto for immigration reformers who are split between those who back the Dream 9 and those who want to sacrifice them for political expediency . David Leopold , former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association , callously dismissed the Dream 9 action as a &quot; publicity stunt &quot; and a distraction . All nine will get asylum hearings . The letter -- signed by Reps. Mike Honda , D-California , Raul Grijalva , D-Arizona , and Ruben Hinojosa , D-Texas , among others -- describes the activists as &quot; victims of our broken immigration policy &quot; who &quot; deserve to come home to the United States . &quot; . Immigration reformers were bound to lose confidence in this administration . Searching for the American Dream in Mexico . There &apos;s not room for nine more ? Maybe there would be more compassion on the Potomac if these young people hadn &apos;t embarrassed Obama , put the lie to the fairy tale that this administration has been compassionate toward immigrants , divided self-serving organizations such as the lawyers group AILA , and pitted one group of immigration reformers against another -- those who want to protect the Dreamers versus those who want to protect the president . The Dream 9 are back where they belong -- in the United States . The fault lines it exposed within the immigration reform movement remain .
( CNN ) When photographer Fabio Bucciarelli first visited South Sudan , he found a nation filled with hope . He found citizens worn out by decades of war -- but looking forward to an independent , peaceful future . That was two years ago , after the world &apos;s youngest country split from its northern nemesis , Sudan . &quot; Tired but happy , hopeful for a better future after a past full of pain and war . &quot; . Instead of jubilant faces of hope , he saw defeated faces haunted by a return of ghosts of past wars . He described the violence in South Sudan as an &quot; invisible &quot; conflict . &quot; It represents one of the longest and most forgotten African wars , &quot; he said . &quot; It &apos;s hard to find front-line war photography of the kind we &apos;ve seen in Libya or Syria , &quot; Bucciarelli said . &quot; The images in South Sudan are different . They describe visually the effect of the impending war , lending you a view of the civilian and military populations and providing a glimpse of life inside a murky , not clearly defined conflict . &quot; . The latest conflict erupted in December last year , when President Salva Kiir accused his fired deputy , Riek Machar , of an attempted coup . The conflict has wiped out entire neighborhoods and transformed into a full-blown war between two large tribes , the Nuer and the Dinka . &quot; South Sudan &apos;s war represents one of the longest and most forgotten African conflicts , &quot; he said . Follow @ CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography . South Sudan split from Sudan in 2011 as part of a peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa &apos;s largest nation . That war left 2 million people dead and ended with the peace agreement that included an independence referendum for the south .

( CNN ) -- The retrial of Egypt &apos;s former president , Hosni Mubarak , on charges of killing protesters during the country &apos;s 2011 revolution and profiteering resumed Saturday before being adjourned until next month . Mubarak was forced from office in February 2011 following two weeks of mass street protests . Following a lengthy trial , he and his former interior minister , Habib al-Adly , were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year on charges that they were complicit in the protesters &apos; killings . After appealing their convictions , they were granted a new trial early this year . Six of Mubarak &apos;s former security aides last year were acquitted of charges related to the killings , and Mubarak &apos;s two sons -- Gamal and Alaa -- were acquitted of corruption charges . But they , too , were ordered to be retried after President Mohamed Morsy , himself ousted this week , ordered a new investigation last year . Mubarak and the other defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges . Mubarak was present in court Saturday for the fourth session of the retrial , wearing his signature sunglasses . The retrial has been adjourned until August 17 , the prosecution said in a statement . A public prosecutor sent Mubarak -- who spent months detained in a military hospital -- back to prison in April . Mubarak &apos;s health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration . He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had maintained that he was physically unfit to stand trial . Mubarak has been held since his guilty verdict last year . He also faces a corruption charge that was not part of the original trial . Mubarak is accused of selling natural gas to neighboring Israel for prices below fair market value . The ousted autocratic leader spent three decades in charge of Egypt , the most populous Arab country .

Man Haron Monis , an Iranian-born refugee who was granted political asylum in Australia in 2001 , had &quot; a long history of violent crime , infatuation with extremism and mental instability , &quot; Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters . New South Wales Premier Mike Baird said authorities were investigating why Monis -- who was killed in the siege -- was at large , given his criminal background . Court documents show Monis was also facing 45 sex-related charges , including sexual intercourse without consent and aggravated indecent assault . Monis was using the name Mohammad Hassan Manteghi -- his birth name , according to Iran &apos;s state news agency IRNA -- and claimed to be a &quot; healer , &quot; according to the report . Monis fled his homeland in 1995 while being sought for allegedly committing fraud , Iran &apos;s semi-official Fars News reported . A spokesperson at Iran &apos;s embassy in Canberra told CNN that Tehran had officially requested Monis &apos;s extradition but nothing had come of it . Monis had been granted political asylum in 2001 and had had no further contact with his birth country , the spokesperson said . Manny Conditsis , a lawyer who acted for Monis in relation to the accessory to murder and letter-writing charges , told CNN his former client had been a cleric in Shiite Iran , but had become critical of the Islamic Republic &apos;s government in the late 1990s , and fled to Australia &quot; because he was going to be killed . &quot; . He had left behind a wife and two children , who he believed Monis had not seen since . The site describes Monis as a Muslim cleric and activist based in Sydney who has &quot; continuously been under attack &amp; false accusation by the Australian government &amp; media since he started his political letter campaign from 2007 . &quot; . Conditsis told Australian public broadcaster ABC that Monis was an isolated figure who was probably acting alone .

Google announced a Gmail app for the iPhone , iPad and iPod Touch that was designed to make it easier for the service &apos;s more than 190 million users to navigate their mail . &quot; We check email pretty much everywhere these days , &quot; Google content manager Matthew Izatt wrote on the Gmail blog . Users of Apple &apos;s operating system could already access Gmail through a mobile site or set it up as their default e-mail account . But the new app promised a smoother experience with a host of new features . &quot; Go get the iPhone app for Gmail ! &quot; The Gmail app is really a piece of crud , &quot; he wrote . Shortly after it was unveiled , the app was pulled from the Apple Store . &quot; The iOS app we launched today contained a bug with notifications , &quot; Google posted on its Gmail Twitter account . &quot; We have pulled the app to fix the problem . &quot; Earlier today we launched a new Gmail app for iOS , &quot; Google posted . &quot; Unfortunately , it contained a bug which broke notifications and caused users to see an error message when first opening the app . We &apos;ve removed the app while we correct the problem , and we &apos;re working to bring you a new version soon . Everyone who &apos;s already installed the app can continue to use it . &quot; . The app ... at least the fully working version of it ... will send push notifications and sound cues when new messages are received , search your inbox for an e-mail , autocomplete e-mail addresses and upload photos to messages . It will also feature the same Priority Inbox that Gmail &apos;s Web version has and add a new mobile interface that will allow users to navigate their inbox more quickly with touch controls . There was no word from Google Wednesday afternoon as to when the fixed app might be back up .
Washington ( CNN ) -- A hearing continues Thursday to determine the future of John Hinckley Jr . , who shot President Ronald Reagan and three others in March 1981 . But prosecutors are fighting that , saying Hinckley has been deceptive about his activities while on visits to his mother in Williamsburg , Virginia . Hinckley &apos;s attorney , Barry Levine , said the issue is not whether Hinckley has sometimes been deceptive but whether he is dangerous . &quot; This man is not dangerous and the evidence shows he is not dangerous , &quot; Levine said . Levine said that in the two and a half decades that Hinckley has been at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington to undergo treatment and during his visits outside that facility , there has &quot; not been a single act of violence . &quot; . Since 1999 , Levine said , Hinckley has been taking a drug called Risperdal . Jones said he has interviewed Hinckley but has not treated him . According to Jones , Hinckley &apos;s treatment team was informed by the Secret Service that Hinckley had not told the truth about his activities during several visits . Jones said the medical staff discussed this issue with Hinckley , who initially did not appear to view the issue as a big deal , but later understood it was a serious issue . Asked about the photographs of the dentist , Jones said the photographs were of the woman graduating from dental school and were &quot; not salacious . &quot; . The first step would allow Hinckley to have two visits of 17 days . That would be followed by six visits of 24 days . On March 30 , 1981 , Hinckley waited for President Reagan to leave a Washington Hotel after a speech . He opened fire and hit Reagan , his press secretary James Brady , Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington police officer Thomas Delahanty .
While he will still be able to raise and spend campaign funds because he did not officially drop out , Cain &apos;s White House bid is effectively over . Cain said he came to the decision after assessing the impact that the allegations were having on his wife , his family and his supporters . Cain and his wife , Gloria , held hands as they walked up to the podium where Cain made his remarks in Atlanta . &quot; Your support has been unwavering and undying , &quot; Cain told his supporters . Respondents said they were most concerned that Cain does not understand important issues , but said the allegations against him contribute to their concern , the newspaper said . This week , White told the news media that she and Cain engaged in an on-and-off affair for more than 13 years . White issued a statement , through her attorney , after Cain &apos;s announcement Saturday . In a fund-raising letter Tuesday night , Cain referred to White as &quot; troubled . &quot; . Two other women also have said Cain sexually harassed them while they worked at the association , but they have declined to be identified . Cain told the Union Leader in New Hampshire that he repeatedly gave White money to help her with &quot; month-to-month bills and expenses . &quot; &quot; I send checks to a lot of people ; I help a lot of people , &quot; Cain told Fox News on Thursday . In the interview , Cain said his wife , knew nothing about White nor his financial support for her until the mother of two came forward last week . Cain &apos;s most prominent supporter in the state , former GOP state party chair Jack Kimball , said he would wait to learn who Cain would endorse before making his own decision . Cain told the newspaper he would drop out of the race if his wife asked him to , but quickly added that she wouldn &apos;t .
( CNN ) -- Four years ago , Brandon Stanton became New York City &apos;s unofficial photo-chronicler . His first stop : Iraq and Jordan . Though his trip was &quot; months in the works , &quot; Stanton didn &apos;t anticipate that his arrival in Erbil , Iraq would coincide with that of ISIS . &quot; My idea of what constitutes personal tragedy has been expanded a lot just listening to what these people are going through , &quot; admits Stanton . For the Yazidis he approached -- from the student who had to abandon his long sought after Master &apos;s degree to flee bombs to the mother whose children can &apos;t stop crying for home -- Stanton found himself falter at the prospect of pursuing his traditional line of questioning . &apos; Pack a bag and get ready to run &apos; . The day Stanton landed in Iraq , ISIS captured the Mosul Dam . His time there , he admits , was often terrifying . &quot; When I was in Dohuk , there was a moment I got a call in the middle of the night from UNICEF telling to pack a bag and get ready to run , because ISIS was shelling the town and had broken through the lines , &quot; he recalls . It was one of many moments , he admits , when he appreciated what it means to feel secure . And I realized that in the absence of physical security , no other layers of life can really be experienced , &quot; he says . &quot; That constant uncertainty seeps into your psyche in a way that you can &apos;t really pinpoint until you go back to a place that is secure . &quot; . For Stanton , that place was Jordan . &quot; I really noticed when I landed in Jordan , where the infrastructures was in place and there was no imminent threat , that there was a load lifted from my psyche , &quot; he says . In the absence of immediate danger , there was hope .
Not for nothing was the name Nixon , Bush or Dole on the GOP presidential ticket from 1952 to 2004 . In contrast , Democrats have favored the presidential candidate with the hot hand , rising from obscurity to the White House -- think Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton and Barack Obama . But a fresh-out-of-the-oven CNN presidential poll shows a fractured GOP field of newcomers with no clear front-runner while the Democrats have given an unprecedented lead to a brand name of their own : Hillary Clinton . On the GOP side of the aisle , New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie narrowly leads the fractured field at 17 % , one point above Rep. Paul Ryan , best known as Mitt Romney &apos;s vice presidential running mate . But that doesn &apos;t seem to be the case for Ryan , who emerged from the 2012 presidential race arguably damaged by his association with the Romney campaign . Perhaps most interesting is the second tier of GOP candidates . Below Biden are first-term Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 7 % , New York Gov. And while successful governors like Cuomo and O &apos;Malley have earned the right to be taken seriously as presidential candidates , the party faithful don &apos;t seem to be much interested in buying what they are selling at the moment . If Clinton does not run for some reason , Democrats will quickly wake up to the awkward fact that they have almost no depth of the bench after two Obama terms . So there you have it : Democrats are behaving like Republicans , falling in line behind the big brand name dominating a race that is still three years away . And Republicans are behaving like Democrats , putting forward a fractured field with no clear front-runners but elevating a New Jersey governor , a Wisconsin congressman and a Kentucky senator to the front of the pack .
( Tribune Media Services ) -- When Eileen Mather lands in Mexico City on her way to Tapachula , Mexico , she learns her airline ticket isn &apos;t valid . Her airline forces her to buy a new one . Mather asks her online agency , Cheapoair.com , for a refund , but more than six months later , she &apos;s still out $ 879 . Q : I need your help getting my money back for a plane ticket I had to pay for twice . Here &apos;s my story : I bought tickets online through Cheapoair.com from Philadelphia to Tapachula , Mexico . So I had to buy new tickets . After I returned home , I faxed all of my documents to a supervisor at Cheapoair . I &apos;ve called her repeatedly and left messages , but no one has contacted me , and I &apos;m out $ 879 . A : You shouldn &apos;t have to pay twice for your airline tickets . Reservations can be lost , paper tickets and boarding passes can be misread . Cheapoair may -- or may not -- have been responsible for your non-working tickets . But as your online travel agent , it was responsible for helping you fix it . The online agency shouldn &apos;t have kept you in a holding pattern for more than six months . If you had arrived at the airport a half-hour earlier , you might have been able to speak with a supervisor and straightened this out . Once you were home , and were running into a brick wall with Cheapoair &apos;s supervisor , I would have tried knocking on the front door again . I contacted Cheapoair on your behalf . It apologized for the delay and said it contacted Aviasca , but couldn &apos;t determine why your ticket wasn &apos;t accepted . An airline representative told Cheapoair it would have to speak to the agent who was working at the ticket counter when you checked in , which was impossible . Cheapoair refunded the $ 879 you spent on your second ticket .
Shanghai is an unusual place . The Bund refers to Shanghai &apos;s waterfront on the west bank of Huangpu River . It &apos;s now in the lobby of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank , the building &apos;s current occupier . According to Emporis , a global real estate data provider based in Germany , Shanghai ranks sixth among world cities with the most skyscrapers . Next in line is the 632-meter Shanghai Tower . The 258-room hotel -- a joint venture between Shanghai Jinjiang Hotel Group and Interstate Hotels and Resorts -- will occupy the 84th through 110th floors of the Shanghai Tower . When international events set up in China , Shanghai is as often as not the default host city . Large-scale events in Beijing tend to carry political messages , while those in Shanghai focus more on fun and glamor . The Chinese Formula One Grand Prix is one of the biggest annual events in Shanghai . The Shanghai Masters ( October 4-12 ) tennis championship is attended by the highest-ranking players of the year . Shanghai is also building a Disneyland . High-quality international restaurants are springing up in Shanghai so quickly that it &apos;s hard to keep track of them all . When Russians fleeing the October Revolution of 1917 came to Shanghai , they brought their borscht . Colonial history has trickled down to Shanghai &apos;s local lingo . Shanghai dialect is filed with localized English words and pidgin English cultural identifiers unique to Shanghainese . Shikumen is Shanghai &apos;s indigenous alleyway housing . When the Communist Party took over in 1949 , shikumen architecture was at its height -- there were around 200,000 shikumen buildings throughout central Shanghai , each divided into tenements to house five or even ten families . Now based in London , Tracy You is a native and longtime resident of Shanghai and a former CNN travel producer .
HARARE , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) -- Zimbabwean lawmakers on Monday narrowly voted for Lovemore Moyo as speaker of the parliament -- making him the first opposition lawmaker to hold the position in the country &apos;s history . Morgan Tsvangirai &apos;s MDC faction has a slim majority following parliamentary elections . The speaker of the parliament is the fourth most powerful post in Zimbabwe . Themba-Nyathi represented the splinter MDC faction led by Arthur Mutambara , but he had support of President Robert Mugabe &apos;s ZANU-PF party . The vote took place hours after Mugabe swore in lawmakers , five months after they were elected . Two members of the main MDC -- led by presidential candidate Morgan Tsvangirai -- were arrested as they arrived at the opening session , but they were released after a short time , according to a government spokesman . One of those detained -- Shuwa Mudiwa -- appeared back in parliament , but the other member -- Elia Jembere -- was not seen , according to sources . Attendance at the session of parliament is important since the membership is closely divided between the MDC and the Mugabe &apos;s ZANU-PF . The ruling ZANU-PF party lost its majority in the 210-seat parliament in elections in March , but vote recounts and political violence have delayed the body from convening until now . Final results gave 100 seats to an MDC faction led by Morgan Tsvangirai , the party &apos;s presidential candidate . President Robert Mugabe &apos;s ZANU-PF got 99 seats . Tsvangirai , who was locked in a bitter presidential contest with Mugabe , had objected to Mugabe &apos;s decision to convene parliament , saying it could &quot; decapitate &quot; power-sharing talks that have been on hold for the past two weeks . MDC party spokesman Nelson Chamisa said all MDC members elected to parliament were expected to attend &quot; except those few MPs who are still in hiding . &quot; .
During 15 years of talking to high school students about sex and bullying , Laurie Halse Anderson has continued to get the same questions from boys : Why was the main character in her book , &quot; Speak , &quot; so upset about what happened to her ? Anderson , who published the award-winning novel in 1999 , believes the questions come from an honest place . They &apos;re teen boys , after all , growing up in a society where media and pop culture tell them women are created for sexual gratification . And yet , many parents still struggle to find the words or the courage to talk to teens about sex and intimacy , Anderson said . As a mother who raised four girls , Anderson knows that parents today are navigating uncharted territory when it comes to adolescent sexuality , and they &apos;re doing it earlier than parents in other generations . For the 15th anniversary of &quot; Speak , &quot; Anderson is lending her support to the Rape , Abuse &amp; Incest National Network , a resource for survivors of sexual violence . Anderson said she wrote &quot; Speak &quot; based on her own experience of being raped as a teen . Although many students first encountered &quot; Speak &quot; in high schools , it &apos;s now being taught in middle schools , Anderson said . &quot; It used to be that we teach girls not to be raped , but we need to start teaching boys not to be rapists , and that &apos;s a really hard thing for parents of boys to process , &quot; she said . The term &quot; young adult lit &quot; was hardly in use when Anderson wrote &quot; Speak . &quot; A teacher who uses &quot; Speak &quot; in her classroom told Anderson that she calls it &quot; resilience literature , &quot; a term Anderson said she is proud of . &quot; Speak &quot; is about teen rape , the pressures of high school and the insularity of small-town life , but most importantly , it &apos;s about overcoming stigma , Anderson said .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation . Raymond Soeoth , pictured here with his wife , says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will . Two immigrants , Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa , told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will . &quot; The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling , particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards , &quot; Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail . Responding to Lieberman &apos;s written questions , Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had &quot; medical escorts &quot; for deportation since 2003 . Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7 , 2004 , he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days . See the document that shows Soeoth was injected . Soeoth &apos;s medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol , even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness . In the records , the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making . &quot; Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees , &quot; the ICE statement said . But , Diouf says , he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported . See Diouf &apos;s stay of deportation document . If they lose , they may land back in the hands of ICE , once again facing deportation .
( CNN ) -- A memorial cruise is scheduled to set sail 100 years after the sinking of the Titanic , following the same trans-Atlantic route as the ill-fated ship , according to organizers . A list of first class passengers for the R.M.S. Titanic is one of the artifacts that remains after the sinking . The Titanic Memorial Cruise is to set sail in April 2012 , departing from Southampton , England , on April 8 , just as the Titanic did . On April 15 , the ship -- the Balmoral -- will arrive at the spot in the North Atlantic where the Titanic sank after it collided with an iceberg . Passengers on the 2012 cruise will take part in a memorial service at the site , according to organizer Miles Morgan Travel . Artifacts from the Titanic and a piece of the ship &apos;s hull have been recovered , but most of the wreckage remains where the luxury cruise liner sank . The 12-night memorial cruise will then take passengers to Halifax in Nova Scotia , Canada , so they can visit cemeteries where some of the Titanic victims are buried . The trip will end in New York , where the Titanic was headed . Prices for the trip start at $ 3,900 . Millvina Dean , thought to be the last survivor of the Titanic , died in June 2009 at age 97 , according to friends . Dean was an infant when the Titanic -- publicized as &quot; practically unsinkable &quot; and as the largest passenger steamship at the time -- struck an iceberg on the night of April 14 , 1912 , during its maiden voyage from Southampton in southern England to New York . The ship sank less than three hours later , killing more than 1,500 people . Dean &apos;s brother and mother also survived the sinking .

GENEVA , Switzerland ( CNN ) -- The number of confirmed swine flu cases across the globe kept rising Friday , but some signs of hope emerged in the battle against the worldwide outbreak . The World Health Organization said Friday that the number of confirmed cases stood at 367 worldwide , including 141 in the United States and 156 in Mexico . Meanwhile , researchers worked to develop a vaccine for swine flu , which is also known as 2009 H1N1 . &quot; Of course we would like to have a vaccine tomorrow . The steps involved in producing a vaccine involve isolating a strain of the virus , which has already been done , and tweaking it so manufacturers can make a vaccine , Kieny said . The WHO said Mexico has 156 confirmed cases and nine deaths . Mexican authorities say they have confirmed 16 deaths and at least 358 cases , and they suspect more than 150 deaths may have been caused by the flu . See where cases have been confirmed » . One death in the United States has been attributed to swine flu -- a toddler from Mexico whose family brought him to Texas for medical treatment . The effects in Mexico reflect the fear and concern across the globe , including in the United States , where schools and parents are taking precautions in academics , graduations and sports because of the flu . The U.S. Department of Education said Friday that 433 public and nonpublic schools in 17 states had been closed because of the flu outbreak . CDC officials at a news conference Friday were asked to compare the strain with the deadly 1918 virus .

In Alaska , it &apos;s advisable to look before you land . That &apos;s because , in Alaska , where seaplanes are common , you just might land on a whale . But as the plane lowers , it &apos;s clear something is different about this approach . &quot; All the sudden , the pilot advanced the throttle and I didn &apos;t know why . I thought , &apos; Oh something must be wrong , &apos; &quot; Hamm told CNN . That something was a whale , a humpback , swimming just under the surface . For a moment , it appeared the whale and plane would collide . But the pilot pulled up , getting just enough lift to avoid the mammal . The plane landed safely seconds later . Later Hamm showed the pilot the video he shot . Hamm said the pilot told him he didn &apos;t notice the whale ; he reacted to the commotion on the shore . Right as the pilot pulled up , the whale breached , clearing his blowhole and drenching the plane &apos;s windshield . Rare albino whale &apos; parades &apos; off Australian coast .
Dallas ( CNN ) -- Some may disagree whether George W. Bush was a &quot; uniter , not a divider , &quot; as he liked to say , but he did get all five living presidents together for the dedication of his presidential library . At Thursday &apos;s event in Dallas , Democratic former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton praised Bush for his initiatives in Africa , and Bush defended his record . &quot; The political winds blow left and right , polls rise and fall , supporters come and go , but in the end , leaders are defined by the convictions they hold , &quot; Bush said at the ceremony for the George W. Bush Presidential Center . Bush has said he is aware that the opening of his presidential library would reopen debates over the Iraq War and the policies he pursued after the September 11 terrorist attacks . Bush kept his word and acted , Carter said . &quot; George W. Bush is responsible for that . &quot; . &quot; That &apos;s what President George W. Bush chose to do , &quot; Obama said . The center &apos;s library and museum take visitors through the turning points of Bush &apos;s two terms . Bush 43 : &apos; History will ultimately judge &apos; . As the son of another former president , Bush said he wouldn &apos;t mind seeing his brother Jeb Bush run for the highest office . If he could make the decision for Jeb , he would tell him to run for president , Bush said . But in an interview Thursday on NBC &apos;s &quot; Today , &quot; former first lady Barbara Bush said that while Jeb Bush is able to do the job , she would like to see other families in the White House . In addition to the library and museum , the Presidential Center includes the George W. Bush Institute , a public policy institute .
See the performance by Sebastien De La Cruz . Here &apos;s a sampling of some of the unkind tweets that went flying around the Internet about Sebastien de la Cruz : . As for Sebastien , he said the racist comments have not fazed him . &quot; For those that said something bad about me , I understand it &apos;s your opinion , &quot; said Sebastien to CNN . Sebastien has been singing since he was 5 but gained fame in 2012 after being on NBC &apos;s &quot; America &apos;s Got Talent &quot; for singing his mariachi ballads with hopes of winning to help his younger brother get surgery for his hearing problem . Juan de la Cruz , Sebastien &apos;s father , hasn &apos;t taken the negative comments personally at all . &quot; I think people reacted the way they did because Sebastien was wearing his mariachi outfit , &quot; said de la Cruz , &quot; But , it doesn &apos;t make sense to listen to those people when most of the feedback we have gotten is positive . San Antonio supports Sebastien . &quot; . The blog highlighted 28 tweets from NBA fans who came off as offended and ashamed that the Spurs would allow the boy , who happened to have been born and raised in San Antonio , to sing the nation &apos;s anthem . After the harsh reaction spread across the Internet , tweets supporting and defending Sebastien and vociferously denouncing his critics started to take over : . -- &quot; Why are ppl so upset over a Hispanic singing the national anthem . -- And , from the American Latino Museum , &quot; We &apos;re proud of the 11-year old San Anto-native Sebastien de la Cruz for his amazing performance last night ! &quot; . It will take a lot more than some racist tweets to bring Sebastien down . Sebastien said today was like any other day , but he &apos;s always grateful to wake up to yet another day able to sing . See how Sebastien is handling the reaction .
