It &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s official : U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria . Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night , hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons . There are key questions looming over the debate : What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria ? U.N. inspectors leave Syria . Obama &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria , carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb . Bergen : Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. Obama : &apos; This men@@ ace must be confronted &apos; . On Saturday , Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . Syria &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month &quot; is an assault on human dignity , &quot; the president said . Obama decision came Friday night . Syria : Who wants what after chemical weapons horror . British Prime Minister David Cameron , whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week , responded to Obama &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s speech in a Twitter post Saturday . &quot; I understand and support Barack Obama &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s position on Syria , &quot; Cameron said . What do Syria &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s neighbors think ? . After Obama &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s speech , a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is &quot; embarrass@@ ed &quot; that Russia opposes military action against Syria , is &quot; crying for help &quot; for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defe@@ ats -- on the political and military levels . An anchor on Syrian state television said Obama &quot; appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies . &quot; . On Saturday , Obama said &quot; all told , well over 1,000 people were murdered . &quot;
( CNN ) -- U@@ sain Bolt rounded off the world championships Sunday by claiming his third gold in Moscow as he anchored Jamaica to victory in the men &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s 4@@ x@@ 100@@ m relay . The fastest man in the world charged clear of United States rival Justin Gat@@ lin as the Jama@@ ican quar@@ t@@ et of N@@ esta Carter , K@@ em@@ ar Bail@@ e@@ y-@@ Cole , Nick@@ el Ash@@ me@@ ade and Bolt won in 3@@ 7.@@ 36 seconds . The U.S finished second in 3@@ 7.@@ 56 seconds with Canada taking the bronze after Britain were disqualified for a fa@@ ulty handover . The 26-year-old Bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships , equ@@ aling the record held by American trio Carl Lewis , Michael Johnson and Al@@ ly@@ son F@@ eli@@ x , not to mention the small matter of six Olympic titles . &quot; I &@@ apos@@ ;@@ m proud of myself and I &@@ apos@@ ;@@ ll continue to work to dominate for as long as possible , &quot; Bolt said , having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 Rio Olympics . Gat@@ lin str@@ ayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their bat@@ on and was never able to get on terms with Bolt . Earlier , Jamaica &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s women under@@ lined their domin@@ ance in the sprint events by winning the 4@@ x@@ 100@@ m relay gold , anchored by Shel@@ ly-@@ Ann Fr@@ as@@ er-@@ Pr@@ y@@ ce , who like Bolt was completing a triple . Defending champions , the United States , were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between Alexandria Anderson and English Gardner , but promoted to silver when France were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover . Fr@@ as@@ er-@@ Pr@@ y@@ ce , like Bolt aged 26 , became the first woman to achieve three gol@@ ds in the 100-@@ 200 and the relay . Bolt &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s final d@@ ash for golden glory brought the eight-@@ day championship to a r@@ ousing finale , but while the hosts topped the medal table from the United States there was criticism of the poor attend@@ ances in the Lu@@ zh@@ ni@@ ki Stadium .
Kansas City , Missouri ( CNN ) -- The General Services Administration , already under investigation for l@@ av@@ ish spending , allowed an employee to telec@@ om@@ m@@ ute from Hawaii even though he is based at the G@@ SA &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s Kansas City , Missouri , office , a CNN investigation has found . Under the program , employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which they &@@ apos@@ ;@@ re actually assigned . The Kansas City employee , who started his job in January 2011 , is paid $ 8@@ 4,@@ 4@@ 40 and works from his home in Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , a G@@ SA representative confirmed . Jason Kl@@ um@@ b , the G@@ SA &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s regional administrator for Kansas City , defended the hire . &quot; The cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candi@@ d@@ acy as an employee as compared with the other applicants , &quot; Kl@@ um@@ b said . Kl@@ um@@ b called the G@@ SA &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s tele@@ working program &quot; a successful program that &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers . &quot; . And a G@@ SA employee in Kansas City , who requested anonymity , said that hiring someone in Hawaii to work for the Kansas City region was l@@ ud@@ ic@@ r@@ ous . &quot; When you consider everything you need when you hire someone , it would have been better to look for someone in the Kansas City area . Dan T@@ an@@ gh@@ er@@ lin@@ i , who was appointed acting G@@ SA administrator this year , said the agency was examining the cost of the entire tele@@ working program . The G@@ SA &quot; virtual employee &quot; program is different from tele@@ work programs offered by many private companies including CNN &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s parent company , Turner Broad@@ casting , in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week , partially to reduce traffic con@@ g@@ estion . The details requested by Issa about the G@@ SA program have not been provided to the committee . In July , a CNN investigation revealed that the G@@ SA &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s Kansas City office spent more than $ 20,000 to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit .
Burk@@ hart , a 24-year-old German national , has been charged with 37 counts of arson following a string of 52 fires in Los Angeles . The charges are in connection with arson fires at 12 locations scattered through Hollywood , West Hollywood and Sher@@ man O@@ aks , according to authorities . &quot; This defendant has engaged in a prot@@ rac@@ ted campaign in which he has set , the people believe , up@@ wards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community , &quot; Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Sean Carney said . The worst arson sp@@ re@@ es in the city &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s history began last Friday morning with a car fire in Hollywood that spread to apar@@ tments above a garage , but no new fires have happened since Burk@@ hart was arrested Monday , Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Co@@ ol@@ ey said . &quot; In numerous instances , the cars were parked in car@@ ports , resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings , &quot; a sworn affidavit from a Los Angeles arson investigator said . &quot; It is my opinion that the defendant &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s criminal spree was motivated by his rage against Americans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terror@@ ize as many residents of the city and county of Los Angeles as possible , &quot; Nor@@ d@@ sk@@ og wrote . A search of Burk@@ hart &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s Hollywood apartment found newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings about the Los Angeles fires and articles from Germany reporting similar car fires in Frankfurt , Germany in September , 2011 , the investigator said . &quot; It is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in Germany before he came to the United States , &quot; Nor@@ d@@ sk@@ og wrote .

( CNN ) -- Four groups that advocate for immigrant rights said Thursday they will challenge Arizona &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s new immigration law , which allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency . The Mexican American Le@@ gal Defense and Educ@@ ational Fund , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union , the ACLU of Arizona and the National Immigration Law Center held a news conference Thursday in Phoenix to announce the legal challenge . &quot; This law will only make the ramp@@ ant racial profiling of Latinos that is already going on in Arizona much worse , &quot; said Al@@ ess@@ and@@ ra Sol@@ er Me@@ et@@ ze , executive director of the ACLU of Arizona . Republican Arizona Gov. Brewer and others who support the law say it does not involve racial profiling or any other illegal acts . &quot; It is illegal in America , and it &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s certainly illegal in Arizona . &quot; . &quot; Our churches and past@@ ors in Arizona are outraged about the significant threat this anti-@@ immigrant law will have in the lives of Arizona &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s Latinos , &quot; said the Rev. The measure makes it a state crime to live or travel through Arizona illegally . In addition to signing the law , Brewer also issued an executive order that requires training for local officers on how to implement the law without engaging in racial profiling or discrimination . Some officials in Arizona have expressed their dis@@ pleasure with the measure . But a national Republican leader said Thursday that Arizona is just filling a void left by the federal government . The Arizona measure has drawn sharp criticism from the Mexican government , which issued an advisory to its citizens this week . In Arizona , two popular sing@@ ers also will voice their opposition . Arizona , which is on the Mexican border , has about 4@@ 60,000 undocumented immigrants , the federal government says . The other states with more illegal immigrants than Arizona are Texas , Florida , New York and Georgia .
That means politic@@ king will be on the rise , especially as control of the Senate is at stake as well as control of 36 state houses . The race with the most at stake is the one for U.S. Senate in Kentucky . This is not just one of the only Senate races Republicans are at risk of losing , but also the race where the top Senate Republican is at risk of losing his job . The Republican leader of the Senate , Mitch McConnell , is in a fight for his political life against Al@@ ison L@@ under@@ gan Gri@@ mes , a relatively in@@ experienced Democratic politician who was just 8 years old when McConnell started his first term in the Senate in 1985 . Meanwhile , Democrats , backed by labor unions , are again fighting to defeat Walker -- they forced a recall two years ago that Walker won -- to move forward on more Democratic economic policies , including lifting the minimum wage . U.S. Senate , Louisiana : Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu always has tough races , and her fourth bid for the Senate seat is no exception . Republican Rep.

( CNN ) -- If you travel by plane and arriving on time makes a difference , try to book on Hawai@@ ian Airlines . In 2012 , passengers got where they needed to go without delay on the carrier more than nine times out of 10 , according to a study released on Monday . In fact , Hawai@@ ian got even better from 2011 , when it had a 9@@ 2.@@ 8 % on-@@ time performance . Last year , it improved to 9@@ 3.@@ 4 % . The Air@@ line Qu@@ ality R@@ ank@@ ings Report looks at the 14 largest U.S. airlines and is based on an analysis of U.S. Department of Transportation figures .

In addition to on-@@ time performance , the joint project looks at three other categories : rate of consumer complaints , mis@@ handled bags and denied boarding performance . At a time when U.S. airlines are a wh@@ ip@@ ping post for passenger complaints about crowded flights , tight seats , costly tickets and un@@ satis@@ factory service , there is a g@@ lim@@ mer of hope . Eight airlines improved their on-@@ time arrival performance in 2012 . Nine of the 14 rated had an on-@@ time arrival percentage of more than 80 % . Ex@@ pres@@ s@@ Jet and American Airlines had the worst on-@@ time performance ( 7@@ 6.@@ 9 % ) last year , according to the data gathered in the 23rd annual report .

( CNN ) For the second time during his pap@@ acy , Pope Francis has announced a new group of bishops and arch@@ bishops set to become cardinals -- and they come from all over the world . Pope Francis said Sunday that he would hold a meeting of cardinals on February 14 &quot; during which I will name 15 new Car@@ dinals who , coming from 13 countries from every continent , manif@@ est the in@@ dis@@ sol@@ u@@ ble links between the Church of Rome and the particular Chur@@ ches present in the world , &quot; according to Vatican Radio . New cardinals are always important because they set the tone in the church and also elect the next pope , CNN Senior Vatican Analy@@ st John L. Allen said . The new cardinals come from countries such as Ethiopia , New Zealand and Myanmar . &quot; You &@@ apos@@ ;@@ re talking about cardinals from typically overlooked places , like Cape Verde , the Pacific island of T@@ onga , Panama , Thailand , Uruguay . &quot; . &quot; Francis &apos; pattern is very clear : He wants to go to the ge@@ ograph@@ ical peri@@ ph@@ eries rather than places that are already top-@@ heavy with cardinals , &quot; Allen said . Christopher B@@ ell@@ it@@ to , a professor of church history at K@@ ean University in New Jersey , noted that Francis announced his new sl@@ ate of cardinals on the Catholic F@@ east of the E@@ pi@@ ph@@ any , which commemor@@ ates the visit of the Mag@@ i to Jesus &apos; birthplace in Bethlehem . That doesn &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t mean Francis is the first pon@@ tiff to appoint cardinals from the developing world , though . Beg@@ inning in the 19@@ 20s , an increasing number of Latin American chur@@ ch@@ men were named cardinals , and in the 1960s , St. John XXIII , whom Francis can@@ on@@ ized last year , appointed the first cardinals from Japan , the Philippines and Africa .

H@@ AM@@ IL@@ TON , Bermuda ( CNN ) -- Four Chinese nationals of Uyghur ethn@@ icity who had been held at the U.S. military &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , detention facility have been re@@ settled in Bermuda , officials said Thursday . &quot; A@@ bo@@ ve all , this was a humanitarian act , &quot; Bermud@@ an Premier E@@ wart Brown told CNN in an interview at his Cabinet office in Hamilton , Bermuda . They were among 17 Uyghur detainees at the facility set up to hold terror suspects . President Obama has pledged to close the Guantanamo facility , raising questions of what will happen to the more than 200 remaining detainees . A political backlash against bringing any of the detainees to the United States has increased the focus on sending them to other countries . Brown said he read an article on the issue of the Guantanamo Bay detainees &apos; f@@ ates in The Washington Post while he was in Washington for a White House meeting in May . Watch concerns about re@@ sett@@ ling the Uyghur detainees Â» . They left China because they did not agree with the government , she told CNN . The Chinese statement followed an offer by Pal@@ au , a Pacific island nation , to accept the Uyghur detainees . A senior U.S. administration official told CNN the State Department is working on a final agreement with Pal@@ au to settle the matter of the 13 remaining Uyghur detainees . The United States will not send Uyghur detainees cleared for release back to China out of concern that they would be tortured by Chinese authorities . Pal@@ au said it will take in the ethnic Uyghur detainees for humanitarian reasons and because of the &quot; special relationship &quot; between Pal@@ au and the United States . In 2006 , five other Uyghur detainees were transferred to Alban@@ ia , according to the Justice Department , which said it has no reports they took part in any post-@@ re@@ settlement criminal behavior or terrorist activities .
Kathmandu , Nepal ( CNN ) -- A fer@@ oc@@ ious leopard may have killed 15 people in Nepal in a 15-@@ month span , its latest victim a 4-year-old boy that the cre@@ ature dragged away into the jungle to eat . The g@@ ris@@ ly discovery , which came after teams of people searched for the child , marks the 15th victim in the past 15 months in that remote district in western Nepal . The police chief suspects that a single man-@@ eating leopard is responsible for the deaths . Mah@@ es@@ h@@ w@@ or Dha@@ k@@ al , an ec@@ ologist at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation in Kathmandu , agreed that it is unusual to find more than one or two man-@@ eating animals in one area . Khar@@ el said he feared the actual number of people killed by the leopard could be higher than 15 , because others have lost their life to leopard attacks in Ut@@ tar@@ k@@ hand state in northern India , which borders Ba@@ it@@ adi district . &quot; It could be the same leopard , &quot; he said . Of the 15 victims in Nepal so far , two-thirds are children below the age of 10 . The others are older children and a 29-year-old woman who had gone to collect f@@ od@@ der for domestic animals in the nearby forest , a common practice in Nepal . After killing its victim , the leopard takes the body away into the forest to eat . 25,000 ( about $ 300 ) reward to anyone who cap@@ tures or kills the leopard . Contr@@ oll@@ ing this particular leopard has been a challenge for the wildlife officials in Kathmandu . &quot; There is no alternative but to kill the leopard . &quot; . The chief district administrator has granted permission for this particular leopard to be killed . While cases of le@@ op@@ ards killing domestic animals are common , and there are sometimes instances of le@@ op@@ ards killing people in Nepal , this case is &quot; extreme , &quot; Dha@@ k@@ al said .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney on Sunday defended the Bush administration &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s economic record , the invasion of Iraq and the treatment of suspected terrorists , warning that revers@@ ing its anti-@@ terrorism policies endang@@ ers Americans . &quot; We &@@ apos@@ ;@@ ve accomplished nearly everything we set out to do , &quot; ex-@@ Vice President Dick Cheney says Sunday about Iraq . Cheney said the administration appears to be returning to the pre-@@ 2001 model of treating terrorism as a law enforcement issue , rather than a military problem . But Cheney said he and Bush had to spend money to deal with the September 11 , 2001 attacks , the resulting war in Afghanistan , the disaster of 2005 &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s Hurricane Katrina , and the costly and un@@ popular war in Iraq , now nearly six years old . &quot; All of these things required us to spend money that we had not originally planned to spend , or weren &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t originally part of the budget , &quot; Cheney said . But Cheney said the United States has &quot; accomplished nearly everything we set out to do &quot; in Iraq , including establishing a democratic government in the Middle East . Cheney was one of the administration &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s leading advocates of the 2003 invasion of Iraq , pressing the Bush administration &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s argument that Iraq was conce@@ aling weapons of mass destruction and could provide those weapons to terrorists . None of those weapons were found after the invasion , but Cheney said , &quot; We &@@ apos@@ ;@@ ve eliminated that possibility . &quot; . &quot; I don &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t hear much talk about that , but the fact is , the violence level is down 90 percent , &quot; Cheney said . Though considered one of the administration &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s most influential figures , Cheney said President Bush rebu@@ ffed his advice on at least two issues . Watch Cheney t@@ out Bush administration Â» . And Cheney said he argued against the administration &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s policy on North Korea , which tested a nuclear weapon in 2006 . &quot; I had my say , &quot; Cheney told CNN .
Washington ( CNN ) -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a full mental compet@@ ency screening for Omar Gonzalez , who is accused of jumping the White House fence , after a disputed initial examination found him not competent for trial . U.S. District Court Judge Ros@@ em@@ ary Coll@@ yer expressed concern that the initial mental exam , ordered by a mag@@ istr@@ ate judge , was done before she had a chance to hear a legal motion by the defense dispu@@ ting whether the mag@@ istr@@ ate had the authority to order it . David B@@ os , the federal public defender representing Gonzalez , ob@@ jected to any examination in the first place because he says Gonzalez is fit for trial . The 60-@@ minute initial mental examination of Gonzalez at the District of Columbia jail came as a surprise to the judge and to both the government and defense . But the result , finding Gonzalez not competent , can &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t be ignored , Coll@@ yer said in court Tuesday . B@@ os told the judge : &quot; There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Gonzalez is competent to stand trial . &quot; The judge delayed arra@@ ign@@ ment for Gonzalez on new charges the government filed against him last week . Gonzalez was arrested in September after he allegedly jumped the White House fence and sprin@@ ted into the executive mansion , setting off concerns about Secret Service security procedures . His family has said Gonzalez , an Iraq War veteran , suffers from post-@@ traumatic stress disorder and par@@ an@@ o@@ ia . Coll@@ yer said that during the initial examination , the mental health screen@@ er found Gonzalez did understand some parts of the proceedings . The judge suggested that Gonzalez &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s mental issues , which she didn &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t describe more fully , could be resolved with medication . The judge also raised concerns that the government &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s handling of previous unrelated cases could mean it will take some time for Gonzalez to be examined at a federal Bureau of P@@ ris@@ ons facility .

( CNN ) -- Cri@@ min@@ als who file fraudulent tax returns by stealing people &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s identities could r@@ ake in an estimated $ 26 billion over the next five years because the IRS cannot keep up with the amount of the fraud , Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George said Tuesday . &quot; The estimate was based on 2010 figures , which took place before the IRS institu@@ ted major changes with the way it handles identity theft cases , &quot; the IRS statement read . Last year , according to the Treasury Inspector General &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s Office , the IRS reported that of the 2.@@ 2 million tax returns it found to be fraudulent , about 9@@ 40,000 returns totaling $ 6.@@ 5 billion were related to identity theft . The IRS will only select those tax returns that it can verify based on its resources . &quot; . &quot; When the identity th@@ ief files the fraudulent tax return , the IRS does not yet know that the individual &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s identity will be used more than once , &quot; George said . As of last month , the IRS reported that it had stopped the issu@@ ance of $ 1.3 billion in potentially fraudulent tax returns . The IRS says it determined these returns were potentially fraudulent through a sam@@ pling of returns , and it does not believe any legitimate returns were included . &quot; The IRS acknowledges that it does not know the exact number of identity theft incidents or the number of taxpayers affected by identity theft , &quot; George said . The IRS maintains it has certain fil@@ ters in place at the start of the tax filing season to prevent and detect identity theft and fraud , and it says it has recently trained additional employees across the country to deal with the problem . In the past four years , he said , the IRS has identified more than 49@@ 0,000 taxpayers who are the victims of identity theft .
( CNN ) -- A short video that has gone viral in Mexico asks a tough question of the country &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s presidential candidates : &quot; Are you stri@@ ving only for the ( presidential ) chair , or will you change the future of our country ? &quot; .

The video targets the major presidential candidates -- Enrique Pena Nieto , Jos@@ e@@ fin@@ a V@@ az@@ quez M@@ ota and Andre@@ s Manuel Lopez Ob@@ rad@@ or -- and aims to raise awareness about Our Mexico of the Future . The goal of the organization is to collect as many &quot; vi@@ sions &quot; of Mexico &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s future as possible and to comp@@ ile them in a book that will be presented to the candidates before the election . So far , more than 10 million Mexic@@ ans have written or recorded their dreams for a safer or clean@@ er or more toler@@ ant Mexico . &quot; We &@@ apos@@ ;@@ ve had the response we &@@ apos@@ ;@@ ve hoped for , and even exceed@@ ed it , &quot; Martinez said .

Ballet dancer Pav@@ el Dmit@@ rich@@ enko , often cast as the vill@@ ain in Bol@@ sh@@ oi Ballet produc@@ tions , is now the lead defendant in a plot worthy of a T@@ cha@@ ik@@ ov@@ sky score .

Two alleged co-@@ conspir@@ ators have been detained : Al@@ leg@@ ed hit man Yu@@ ri Zar@@ ut@@ sky -- a bur@@ ly , be@@ arded Russian who was previously convicted of beating someone to death -- and Andre@@ y Li@@ pat@@ ov , who allegedly drove the get@@ away car after Zar@@ ut@@ k@@ sy &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s battery acid attack on Fil@@ in . While the final act must still play out in a Russian courtroom , the story opens in the nearly two-@@ cent@@ ur@@ y@@ -old Bol@@ sh@@ oi Theatre . Act 1 - The Bol@@ sh@@ oi Theatre . Ballet is a world where competition is fierce , and where the artistic director wi@@ elds considerable influence in making or breaking careers . Fil@@ in , 42 , was promoted to the Bol@@ sh@@ oi Theatre &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s coveted post in March 2011 , shortly after the deputy ballet director , G@@ enn@@ ady Yan@@ in , who was widely seen as a favorite for the artistic director post , resigned when porno@@ graphic pictures of him surfaced online .

This week the Supreme Court heard two historic cases on marriage . United States v. Windsor asks whether S@@ ection 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act , which defines marriage for federal law and programs as between one man and one woman , is unconstitutional . In Windsor , the defendant was the federal government . Ar@@ tic@@ le III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts . There &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s a second issue in Windsor . E@@ dith Windsor entered into a gay marriage in Canada in 2007 and lived in New York . When her partner died in 2009 , Windsor sued to contest the federal estate tax she paid , claiming a sp@@ ous@@ al exemp@@ tion . But New York did not create gay marriage until 2011 , so Windsor was not harmed by D@@ OM@@ A not allowing the federal government to recognize her marriage , since if the IRS used state defin@@ itions Windsor would still be regarded an a single woman . He openly expressed skep@@ ticism in Holl@@ ing@@ s@@ worth and led the Court in an hour@@ -@@ long debate in Windsor solely focused on whether the court has jurisdiction . Windsor would alter America &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s system of feder@@ alism . If Windsor is historic , Holl@@ ing@@ s@@ worth is earth@@ -@@ sh@@ attering . If the Supreme Court declar@@ es a constitutional right to marriage other than one-@@ man , one-@@ woman , then all traditional marriage laws in all 50 states will be inval@@ id , and there will be a serious debate ( already in a lower federal court ) of whether poly@@ gam@@ ists also have a constitutional right to national recognition . On the mer@@ its , the court seems unlikely to declare an un@@ written constitutional right to gay marriage , though arguments did not go as well for D@@ OM@@ A . It is an energ@@ etic debate in all 50 states , and this summer we will learn whether the Supreme Court will shut down this debate by making it a constitutional issue on which the American people are not allowed to vote .

( CNN ) -- European football &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s governing body , UEFA has revealed that 32 of its 54 member states have declared an interest in hosting matches at the 2020 European Championships . Trad@@ iti@@ onally , the tournament is hosted by one or two nations , but matches in 2020 will be shared between 13 cities across Europe . UEFA , who announced a change in format for the tournament &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s 6@@ 0th anniversary last December , welcomed the enthusi@@ astic response from the national football associ@@ ations . &quot; We are extremely proud to see the huge interest in the bidding process , with more than half of our member associ@@ ations willing to host matches at UEFA E@@ UR@@ O 2020 , &quot; UEFA President Mich@@ el Plat@@ ini said . Plat@@ ini initially flo@@ ated the idea following the 2012 championships hosted by Poland and Ukraine and a decision to change the format was agreed by UEFA &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s Executive Committee last December before being confirmed in January . The format , dubbed a &quot; Euro for Europe , &quot; has attracted interest from reigning Euro champions , Spain and the other traditional power@@ houses of European football -- Germany , France , Italy , Netherlands , Portugal , Greece and England . &quot; UEFA &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s &apos; E@@ UR@@ O for Europe &apos; in 2020 promises to be a fitting way to rec@@ ogn@@ ise 60 years of the UEFA European Championship , &quot; said England Football Association secretary Alex Hor@@ ne in a statement .

New York ( CNN ) -- Northeast Florida State Attorney Angela Corey has made it clear that she alone will decide whether George Zimmerman will be charged in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin . But the question remains , will George Zimmerman be charged ? . They said they had lost contact with their client over the previous two days and revealed Zimmerman &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s unusual behavior -- including phone calls to Fox News host Sean Hann@@ ity and the special prosecutor , Corey . Many suspect that the announcement that Zimmerman had gone rogue forced the special prosecutor &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s hand . If she files charges against Zimmerman , it would be wise not to &quot; over@@ charge &quot; the case . To prove manslaughter in Florida , Corey &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s team would have to prove that Zimmerman &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s acts caused Martin &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s death . So even if Zimmerman killed Martin , he was justified in doing so if he believed he was in danger of being killed himself or of suffering great bo@@ d@@ ily harm . It seems the Sanford Police certainly believed Zimmerman &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s claims . Zimmerman left his home to go to Target and was carrying a conce@@ aled weapon for which he had a permit . Martin was 17 years old , Zimmerman , 28 . The police report describes Martin as 6 feet tall and 160 pounds and lists Zimmerman as 5-@@ foot-@@ 9 . Zimmerman sees Martin , de@@ ems him &quot; suspicious &quot; and calls the police . Zimmerman tells the dispatcher he is following Martin . The dispatcher tells Zimmerman &quot; we don &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t need you to do that . &quot; Martin notic@@ es Zimmerman is following him and tells his girlfriend , De@@ e De@@ e , with whom he is on the phone . Zimmerman says that he returns to his parked SUV and is attacked suddenly by Martin . Martin asks Zimmerman why he is following him . Three witnesses saw Zimmerman str@@ add@@ ling Martin in the grass . The incident happens 70 yards from the home Martin was walking to , not near Zimmerman &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s SUV .
( CNN ) If that car parked in Harvard Yard is a roc@@ kin &apos; , school officials may soon come a knock@@ in &apos; , because h@@ ank@@ y-@@ pan@@ ky between students and faculty at the elite university has officially been banned . Speci@@ fically , the school adopted a new policy this week that prohib@@ its romantic relationships between under@@ graduates and professors . The previous policy only did so between professors and the students they taught . Harvard released a statement saying a specially appointed committee &quot; determined that the existing language on relationships of un@@ equal status did not explic@@ itly reflect the faculty &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s expectations of what constitu@@ ted an appropriate relationship between under@@ graduate students and faculty members ... therefore , the committee re@@ vised the policy to include a clear prohi@@ bition to better acc@@ ord with these expectations . &quot; . The action comes nearly a year after the U.S. Department of Education announced it was investigating 55 colleges and universities , including Harvard , for violations pertaining to Tit@@ le I@@ X , the federal law prohib@@ iting sex discrimination on college camp@@ uses . Harvard responded at the time by saying it had appointed its first ever Tit@@ le I@@ X officer , and that the school &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s president &quot; recently announced the creation of a uni@@ vers@@ ity-@@ wide task force -- composed of faculty , students and staff -- that will recommend how we can better prevent sexual misconduct at Harvard . &quot; .

( CNN ) -- Sergio Garcia , a 36-year-old undocumented immigrant in California , has held two lifelong dreams : to become a U.S. citizen and to practice law . Garcia can be admitted to California &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s state bar and legally practice as a lawyer there , the court ruled . &quot; I &@@ apos@@ ;@@ m super excited to finally be able to ful@@ fill one of my dreams , &quot; Garcia told CNN Friday . But the case raises many questions , particularly among those who have been critical of Garcia &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s efforts to practice law . Garcia says that this an easy initial response to make but that looking at the details of his case , it is not so clear@@ -@@ cut . If anyone feels frustrated the the situation , they should address it with the federal government , Garcia said . Garcia was born in Mexico in 1977 and taken to California by his parents when he was 17 months old , according to court documents . Eight years later , at age 17 , Garcia again returned to California with his parents and without docum@@ entation , though his father had obtained permanent resident status in the United States . That year , Garcia &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s father filed an immigration visa petition on his son &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s behalf , which federal immigration officials accepted in 1995 . The visa still has not been granted , even though Garcia has lived in the state since 1994 . California &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s Supreme Court ruled Thursday ( PDF ) that no state law or public policy should stop Garcia or others like him from obtaining a law license in the state . Asked why he didn &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t choose a different career or pursue other opportunities , Garcia said law was his sing@@ ular focus . &quot; That , and I &@@ apos@@ ;@@ m a little bit st@@ ub@@ born , anyway , &quot; Garcia added . Now that he has a law license , however , one thing that Garcia will not speci@@ alize in is immigration law .
( CNN ) James Best , best known for his portrayal of bum@@ bling sheriff Ros@@ co P.

Although he &@@ apos@@ ;@@ d been a busy actor for decades in theater and in Hollywood , Best didn &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t become famous until 1979 , when &quot; The Du@@ kes of H@@ azz@@ ard &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s &quot; cor@@ n@@ p@@ one char@@ ms began be@@ aming into millions of American homes almost every Friday night . Among the most popular shows on TV in the early &apos; 80s , &quot; The Du@@ kes of H@@ azz@@ ard &quot; ran until 1985 and spawned TV movies , an animated series and video games . Several of Best &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s &quot; H@@ azz@@ ard &quot; co-@@ stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media . &quot; I laughed and learned more from Jim@@ mi@@ e in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year , &quot; co-star John Sch@@ ne@@ ider , who played Bo Duke , said on Twitter . &quot; Every minute of his long life was spent acting , writing , producing , painting , teaching , fishing , or involved in another of his life &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s many pas@@ sions . &quot; . Born Jew@@ el Guy on July 26 , 19@@ 26 , in Pow@@ derly , Kentucky , Best was orph@@ aned at 3 and adopted by Ar@@ men and Es@@ sa Best , who renamed him James and raised him in rural Indiana . Best served in the Army during World War II before launching his acting career .

As a 20-year-old , Ana Ivanovic claimed the French Open on Roland Gar@@ ros &apos; clay courts . Since that win in Paris in 2008 , Ivanovic has suffered from big-@@ match nerves , serving woes and a series of injury problems . &quot; I &@@ apos@@ ;@@ ve been working really hard , &quot; Ivanovic told retired grand slam champion Kim Clijsters in an interview for CNN &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s Open Court show . Her desire to follow up that 2008 French Open win has also led Ivanovic to pon@@ der why she picked up a rack@@ et at the age of five in the first place -- for the enjoy@@ ment . In K@@ on@@ tic , Ivanovic may not have a wise professor on her hands as she did with S@@ ears , yet the 32-year-old , ranked 1,@@ 6@@ 3@@ 5th in men &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s doubles , is able to offer her something that respect within the game cannot always buy -- a shared cultural identity . &quot; I &@@ apos@@ ;@@ m really enjoying someone who speaks the same language and can understand you , &quot; Ivanovic said . Em@@ pl@@ oying a coaching team made up of her comp@@ atriots could be key to Ivanovic performing consistently , according to a former grand slam champion turned coach . Ivanovic &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s solitary grand slam win helped the bas@@ el@@ iner become the world No . W@@ rist , shoulder , foot , ab@@ domin@@ al and hip injuries all took their toll as Ivanovic fell to No . While her playing fortunes might have fl@@ uc@@ tu@@ ated , Ivanovic &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s market@@ ability has never been den@@ ted . Despite Ivanovic &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s obvious talent , Du@@ rie doubts whether her game has the consist@@ ency required to win a grand slam . &quot; She can beat the top players , but to win a grand slam you have to win seven matches . Ivanovic , now 26 , admitted that she too has started thinking about life after tennis .
New York ( CNN ) -- A federal judge has ordered that an official monitor be put in place to prevent discrimination in the hiring of New York City firefighters . U.S. District Judge Nichol@@ as Gar@@ au@@ f@@ is said the city needs &quot; to compreh@@ en@@ sively re@@ assess its policies and practices , to analy@@ ze the evidence showing the effect of those policies and practices , and to r@@ ation@@ ally consider how they can be changed to achieve a firefighter hiring process that is -- in actual practice and effect -- fair and open to all . &quot; . The order requires the city to take remedi@@ al steps to fix discriminatory hiring practices and puts the court monitor in place for at least the next 10 years to make sure those steps are taken . Gar@@ au@@ f@@ is cited &quot; the clear evidence of dispar@@ ate impact that Mayor ( Michael ) Bloomberg and his senior leadership chose to ignore was obvious to anyone else who looked . &quot; . &quot; Instead of facing hard facts and asking hard questions about the City &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s ab@@ y@@ sm@@ al track record of hiring black and Hispanic firefighters , the Bloomberg Administration du@@ g in and fought back , &quot; the judge said in his ruling . L@@ iti@@ gation against the city &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s firefighter hiring practices began in 2007 , when the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint alleging the Fire Department of New York &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s hiring exams neg@@ atively affected black and Hispanic applicants . Bloomberg strongly disagreed with the decision . Bloomberg said 6@@ 1,000 people , more than half of them minorities , applied to the fire department in the last recruiting campaign , &quot; sh@@ attering any previous record for minority applicants . &quot; . Gar@@ au@@ f@@ is acknowledged that the city has improved its minority recruiting , but he said the subsequent hiring processes and &quot; discriminatory testing procedures &quot; have kept many of these minorities from actually being hired .
The sick@@ ening execution , recorded and released online for the world to see , came with a warning to the U.S. : ISIS showed another captive American journalist , believed to be Steven Sot@@ loff , and threatened to kill him too if the U.S. does not stop helping those fighting to stop ISIS advances . The killing and the threat , along with all the evidence ISIS is leaving as it g@@ ou@@ ges its way across the region , are a direct challenge to the American people , to the U.S. government and to the international community . First , obviously , it cannot give into ISIS threats and must continue helping dis@@ lodge ISIS from northern Iraq where it is engaging in ethnic cle@@ ans@@ ing against Christians and other minorities ; kidnapping , raping and selling women ; and mass@@ ac@@ ring people . There are few people on Earth who are not horri@@ fied by ISIS . ISIS is the enemy of anyone who does not belong to ISIS . Any country that disa@@ grees , any government that is not revol@@ ted by ISIS and troubled by its methods and its goals , should go on record saying so . When ISIS calls itself a state , it is not hyper@@ b@@ ole by very much . There have been reports of hundreds , even thousands , of Europeans training , fighting and killing alongside ISIS . Gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ates of the Syria war , from where ISIS pushed into Iraq , have killed in Europe . And ISIS ideology is gaining support in the continent . ISIS can simply not be allowed to keep a f@@ ooth@@ old in the Middle East . It is politically and strateg@@ ically complicated , because ISIS is also fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah , and defeating ISIS would also be enorm@@ ously pleas@@ ing to Iran . That suffering has now extended to Iraq , and it will only become more widespread if ISIS is not stopped .
Q@@ ena , Egypt ( CNN ) -- In a deser@@ ted play@@ ground a few hundred miles south of Cairo , 13-year-old As@@ m@@ aa Ashraf f@@ id@@ d@@ les with a broken ru@@ sted slide . And as the government struggles to w@@ ade through the country &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s prot@@ rac@@ ted political problems , Egypt &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s f@@ est@@ ering education system is orph@@ aned -- even though , with a growing youth population , it &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s key to the country &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s future . In the World Economic Forum &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s latest report on global competi@@ ti@@ veness , Egypt ranked near the bottom -- 13@@ 1st out of 14@@ 4 countries -- for quality of primary education . Egypt &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s liter@@ acy rate is 66 % , according to a 2011 United Nations report . The situation is worst in regions far from the capital , and in Upper Egypt , where more than half the population is under 29 . To make up for the g@@ aps in education , millions of middle-@@ class Egyptian families spend a large part of their income -- sometimes as much as 25 % -- on private t@@ ut@@ oring . Egypt &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s final secondary school exams are a r@@ ite of passage for students . The status qu@@ o is even more s@@ omb@@ er for Egypt &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s women . According to a recent World Bank report , the ill@@ iter@@ acy rate for young people in Upper Egypt is 17 % , higher than the national average of 11 % , and the ill@@ iter@@ acy rates for females is 24 % , almost twice that of m@@ ales . Also , 70 % of young women in Upper Egypt are jo@@ bl@@ ess . But with unemployment at staggering rates -- 33 % for men age 20-@@ 24 and 53 % for women in the same age -- Egypt has a highly com@@ bus@@ tible pool of frustrated and dis@@ en@@ franch@@ ised youth in danger of becoming a lost generation . However , as Egypt &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s public education system foun@@ ders , a few innovative ideas have emerged . Another innovative initiative is T@@ each for Egypt , a start-@@ up created by N@@ ada Ramadan , a 24-year-old Egyptian who &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s a graduate student at Georg@@ etown University in Washington .
A U.S. Air Force spy plane ev@@ aded an encounter with the Russian military on July 18 , just a day after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed by a suspected sur@@ face-to-@@ air missile that Ukraine and the West allege was fired by pro-@@ Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine . The R@@ C-@@ 13@@ 5 Ri@@ v@@ et Joint fled into nearby Swedish airspace without that country &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s permission , a U.S. military official told CNN . The U.S. plane had been flying in international airspace , conducting an electronic e@@ av@@ es@@ dropping mission on the Russian military , when the Russians took the unusual action of beginning to track it with land@@ -based radar . The Russians then sent at least one fighter jet into the sky to inter@@ cept the aircraft , the U.S. official said Saturday . The quick@@ est route away from the Russians took them into Swedish airspace . The U.S. official acknowledged that was done without Swedish military approval . &quot; We acknowledge a U.S. aircraft ve@@ ered into Swedish airspace and will take active steps to ensure we have properly communicated with Swedish authorities in advance to prevent similar issues before they ar@@ ise , &quot; the U.S. State Department said . The incident was first reported by the Swedish news agency S@@ ven@@ sk@@ a D@@ ag@@ bl@@ ad@@ et . This was at least the second pot@@ enti@@ ally-@@ dangerous encounter between a U.S. plane and Russia over the past few months . On April 23 , a Russian Su@@ -@@ 27 Fl@@ an@@ ker fighter jet bu@@ z@@ zed within 100 feet of the nose of a U.S. Air Force R@@ C-@@ 13@@ 5@@ U re@@ conn@@ aissance plane over the Sea of Ok@@ hot@@ sk between Russia and Japan , a Defense Department official said . Russian fighter jet nearly collided with U.S. military plane in April . Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other , both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska . But the official said the land radar activity by the Russians in this instance was unusual .
( CNN ) The attorney for a suburban New York cardi@@ ologist charged in what authorities say was a failed scheme to have another physician hurt or killed is calling the allegations against his client &quot; completely un@@ substanti@@ ated . &quot; . Ap@@ p@@ earing Saturday morning on CNN &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s &quot; New Day , &quot; Randy Zel@@ in defended his client , Dr. Anthony Mos@@ ch@@ et@@ to , who faces criminal solic@@ itation , conspiracy , burglary , arson , criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island . &quot; He &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s got patients to see . They pleaded not guilty in N@@ assa@@ u County District Court , according to authorities . Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a swit@@ ch-@@ activated book@@ shelf , according to prosecutors . During the course of the undercover operation , however , Mos@@ ch@@ et@@ to also sold the officers two semi@@ automatic assault weapons as well as ammunition , prosecutors said . Mos@@ ch@@ et@@ to allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynam@@ ite to &quot; blow up a building . &quot; He later said he no longer needed the dynam@@ ite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead . Kal@@ am@@ ar@@ as and Ch@@ m@@ ela are believed to have taken part in the arson , according to prosecutors . &quot; The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardi@@ ologist whose relationship with Dr. Mos@@ ch@@ et@@ to had sour@@ ed due to a professional dispute , &quot; according to the statement from the district attorney &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s office .

( CNN ) -- Ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts speaking at a Syrian government-@@ sponsored &quot; national dialogue &quot; meeting Sunday criticized recent crack@@ downs by the country &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s security forces , calling for an end to violence against protesters . The Syrian government has claimed armed groups are responsible for the violence at the demonstrations . Syrian researcher Al-@@ Tayy@@ eb T@@ iz@@ z@@ ina also criticized the use of force and asked for violence to stop in order for the dialogue to succeed . Al-@@ Shar@@ a acknowledged that a surge of violence in Syria precip@@ itated Sunday &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s meeting . The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said the meeting included members of the opposition , independent activists , youth leaders and acad@@ em@@ ics . Ambassador Robert Ford was not summoned by Syrian officials on Sunday ; his meeting with Syria &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s foreign minister was previously scheduled by the U.S. Embassy in Damascus last Thursday . He also accused the Syrian government of inc@@ iting Syrians against the United States , including organizing a protest outside the U.S. Embassy Friday and Saturday , the senior State Department official said . State Department spokeswoman Victoria N@@ ul@@ and issued a blunt re@@ but@@ tal to similar Syrian government accusations Friday , calling claims that Ford &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s visit was inc@@ iting protesters &quot; absolute rub@@ b@@ ish &quot; and saying she was &quot; dis@@ may@@ ed &quot; by the Syrian government &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s reaction . The French government summoned Syria &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s ambassador to France on Sunday to issue a formal protest on this matter , and to hold Syrian authorities responsible for the security of French diplomats in the Middle Eastern country . Di@@ plom@@ atic tensions over Syria also flared in Washington last week , with the State Department summon@@ ing Syrian Ambassador Im@@ ad Must@@ ap@@ ha Friday .

Cre@@ ating The A@@ fron@@ au@@ ts , which was sold out in just a few months , De Mid@@ del worked more as a movie director , trying to make the best of the resources around her . &quot; It was like a short , small and very modest movie production , &quot; says De Mid@@ del . De Mid@@ del , who &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s never been to Zambia , acknowledges she &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s not &quot; an expert in Africa &quot; -- nor in space . &quot; I always kept in my mind that I don &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t know a lot about African history and I am approaching a subject that can be sensitive or can be offensive for some people , &quot; says De Mid@@ del . She &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s been contacted by Nigeria &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s space program and been invited to the continent to give talks , while her book is being shown in South Africa and Senegal . If anything , De Mid@@ del says , the extraordinary tale of the forgotten Z@@ amb@@ ian space program presented a chance to talk about Africa from a different perspective .

( CNN ) -- By now , we &@@ apos@@ ;@@ re on the same page that Mitt Romney &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s pick of Paul Ryan as his running mate contrad@@ icts a golden ol@@ die of presidential election strategy -- run to the conservative ( or liberal ) base to win the nomination and then re@@ position toward the center to l@@ ure the more moderate independent swing voters who are necessary to win the general election . Just the opposite -- Romney has doubled down on his move to the right during the primary battle . Give Romney some credit . P@@ ut on your thinking caps and grab an ab@@ ac@@ us , here are the numbers that could put Romney in the White House . To make sure they harvest the Ryan enthusiasts , the Romney campaign appears to be assem@@ bling an impressive operation to turn out the vote and to aggressively compete with the Obama team for the early vote . What makes the Romney mobil@@ ization particularly threatening to Obama is that it targets his biggest challenge -- polls consistently show him ahead but there are omin@@ ous signs that a decisive group of those supporters won &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t actually cast a ballot . This possible weak@@ ness in the Democratic coalition coinc@@ ides with a bit more sli@@ p@@ page among Obama &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s 2008 supporters ( 9 % ) than among McCain voters who won &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t vote GOP in November ( 5 % ) . Bot@@ t@@ om line : By picking the b@@ ona f@@ ide conservative Ryan , the Republican base is likely to deliver a rap@@ tur@@ ous response , which may allow Romney to succeed in explo@@ iting Obama &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s greatest weak@@ ness at this point . All in all , Romney has a tough battle ahead -- even str@@ ingent counts of Electoral College votes based on polls show Obama within striking distance of winning . But using Ryan to ign@@ ite the Republican base is probably Romney &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s most pl@@ au@@ sible path to prev@@ ailing .
The case concerns the torture of O@@ g@@ oni leaders in Nigeria , but at stake is the future of the law under which this case was brought , the Alien Tor@@ t Stat@@ ute . At its best , our nation has played a crucial role in champ@@ ion@@ ing human rights throughout the world and pion@@ eering human rights law . Pass@@ ed in 17@@ 89 , the Alien Tor@@ t Stat@@ ute was a pre@@ sci@@ ent piece of legislation . The Supreme Court court accepted Ki@@ ob@@ el v. Royal Dutch Petroleum last fall after a federal appeals court ruled that the stat@@ ute could not be used to sue corporations . The justices indicated in February that they might question not just the application of the stat@@ ute to corporations but whether and under what circumstances it appl@@ ies to any human rights violations , even by individuals , that take place outside the United States . The case has been brought in the United States because of our nation &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s historical role in promoting the idea of universal rights and in the development of international human rights law . On this grim and mor@@ ally and legally compromised hor@@ izon , the Alien Tor@@ t Stat@@ ute is still one bright spot for human rights advocacy . In the wake of the case , Fil@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ti@@ ga v. PeÃ±@@ a-@@ Ir@@ ala , the Alien Tor@@ t Stat@@ ute developed into a new tool in human rights law . If the stat@@ ute is narr@@ owed and its promise of universal accountability cur@@ t@@ ailed , it will ri@@ ghtly be perceived as yet another step by the U.S. away from its once leading advocacy for human rights . If , on the other hand , the Supreme Court uph@@ olds the Alien Tor@@ t Stat@@ ute , it will signal to the world that we do still believe that people everywhere are entitled to certain fundamental rights and that we will help enforce those rights .
Hong Kong ( CNN ) -- Thousands of people filled Hong Kong &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s Victoria Park on Saturday to mark the 22nd anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men Square . The cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight vig@@ il comes after recent efforts by the Chinese government to qu@@ ash would-be demonstrators from holding anti-government protests . About 26 people were arrested between February and March , according to a Hong K@@ ong@@ -based human rights group , when an anonymous group began an internet campaign calling for anti-government protests in China similar to ones that have taken hold in the Middle East . In response to the campaign , authorities deployed heavy security along major thor@@ ough@@ far@@ es , especially in W@@ ang@@ fu@@ jing , a busy shopping street in downtown Beijing that had been designated by the online group for protests . Saturday &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s protest is an annual event organized by the Hong Kong Alliance , a pro-democracy group . Hong Kong police called it a &quot; peaceful gathering . &quot; . A little more than 22 years ago , students gathered in Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men Square to mem@@ ori@@ alize the recently deceased Hu Y@@ a@@ ob@@ ang . He was fired as Communist Party chief in 1987 by Deng Xi@@ a@@ oping for pushing policies deemed too soft toward &quot; bour@@ ge@@ o@@ is-@@ liberal ideas &quot; and toler@@ ating student protests . The April 15 memorial quickly turned into a pro-democracy movement , and students held talks with the government and later a hunger strike in Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men Square to press their cause . On June 4 , 1989 , Chinese troops in armored personnel carriers and tanks rum@@ bled toward Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men Square . The soldiers , on strict orders to clear the square of demonstrators , had forced their way through the city &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s main thor@@ ough@@ fare .

( CNN ) -- South Korea launched an investigation Tuesday into reports of toxic chemicals being dumped at a former U.S. military base , the Defense Ministry said . The tests follow allegations of American soldiers bur@@ ying chemicals on Korean soil . The first tests are being carried out by a joint military , government and civilian task force at the site of what was Camp Merc@@ er , west of Seoul . &quot; S@@ oil and underground water will be taken in the areas where toxic chemicals were allegedly buried , &quot; said the statement from the South Korean Defense Ministry . Once testing is finished , the government will decide on how to test more than 80 other sites -- all former bases . The alarm was raised this month when a U.S. veteran alleged barrels of the toxic her@@ b@@ icide Agent Orange were buried at an American base in South Korea in the late 1970s . Two of his fellow soldiers cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated his story about Camp Carroll , about 18@@ 5 miles ( 300 kilometers ) southeast of the capital , Seoul . &quot; We &@@ apos@@ ;@@ ve been working very closely with the Korean government since we had the initial claims , &quot; said Lt.

( CNN ) When photographer Fab@@ io Buc@@ ci@@ ar@@ elli first visited South Sudan , he found a nation filled with hope . He found citizens worn out by decades of war -- but looking forward to an independent , peaceful future . That was two years ago , after the world &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s youngest country split from its northern n@@ em@@ esis , Sudan . &quot; T@@ ired but happy , hopeful for a better future after a past full of pain and war . &quot; . Instead of ju@@ bil@@ ant faces of hope , he saw defeated faces haun@@ ted by a return of gh@@ os@@ ts of past wars . He described the violence in South Sudan as an &quot; in@@ visible &quot; conflict . &quot; It represents one of the longest and most forgotten African wars , &quot; he said . &quot; It &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s hard to find front-@@ line war photography of the kind we &@@ apos@@ ;@@ ve seen in Libya or Syria , &quot; Buc@@ ci@@ ar@@ elli said . &quot; The images in South Sudan are different . They describe vis@@ ually the effect of the impending war , lending you a view of the civilian and military populations and providing a glimpse of life inside a mur@@ ky , not clearly defined conflict . &quot; . The latest conflict erupted in December last year , when President Sal@@ va Ki@@ ir accused his fired deputy , R@@ ie@@ k Mach@@ ar , of an attempted coup . The conflict has wi@@ ped out entire neighborhoods and transformed into a full-@@ blown war between two large tribes , the Nu@@ er and the D@@ inka . &quot; South Sudan &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s war represents one of the longest and most forgotten African conflicts , &quot; he said . Foll@@ ow @ CNN@@ Photos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography . South Sudan split from Sudan in 2011 as part of a peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s largest nation .

( CNN ) -- The re@@ trial of Egypt &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s former president , Hosni Mubarak , on charges of killing protesters during the country &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s 2011 revolution and prof@@ it@@ eering resumed Saturday before being ad@@ jour@@ ned until next month . Mubarak was forced from office in February 2011 following two weeks of mass street protests . Following a lengthy trial , he and his former interior minister , H@@ abi@@ b al-@@ Ad@@ ly , were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year on charges that they were compl@@ icit in the protesters &apos; killings . After appealing their convictions , they were granted a new trial early this year . Six of Mubarak &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s former security aides last year were acquitted of charges related to the killings , and Mubarak &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s two sons -- Gamal and Ala@@ a -- were acquitted of corruption charges . But they , too , were ordered to be re@@ tried after President Mohamed Morsy , himself ousted this week , ordered a new investigation last year . Mubarak and the other defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges . Mubarak was present in court Saturday for the fourth session of the re@@ trial , wearing his signature sun@@ glasses . The re@@ trial has been ad@@ jour@@ ned until August 17 , the prosecution said in a statement . A public prosecutor sent Mubarak -- who spent months detained in a military hospital -- back to prison in April . Mubarak &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarcer@@ ation . He suffered a heart attack after re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ishing power and had maintained that he was physically un@@ fit to stand trial . Mubarak has been held since his guilty verdict last year . He also faces a corruption charge that was not part of the original trial . Mubarak is accused of selling natural gas to neighboring Israel for prices below fair market value . The ousted aut@@ ocr@@ atic leader spent three decades in charge of Egypt , the most populous Arab country .

Man Har@@ on Mon@@ is , an Iranian-@@ born refugee who was granted political asylum in Australia in 2001 , had &quot; a long history of violent crime , inf@@ at@@ uation with extremism and mental instability , &quot; Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters .

Washington ( CNN ) -- A hearing continues Thursday to determine the future of John Hinckley Jr . , who shot President Ronald Reagan and three others in March 1981 . But prosecutors are fighting that , saying Hinckley has been dec@@ ep@@ tive about his activities while on visits to his mother in Williamsburg , Virginia . Hinckley &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s attorney , Barry Levine , said the issue is not whether Hinckley has sometimes been dec@@ ep@@ tive but whether he is dangerous . &quot; This man is not dangerous and the evidence shows he is not dangerous , &quot; Levine said . Levine said that in the two and a half decades that Hinckley has been at St. Elizabe@@ ths Hospital in Washington to undergo treatment and during his visits outside that facility , there has &quot; not been a single act of violence . &quot; . Since 1999 , Levine said , Hinckley has been taking a drug called Ris@@ per@@ d@@ al . Jones said he has interviewed Hinckley but has not treated him . According to Jones , Hinckley &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s treatment team was informed by the Secret Service that Hinckley had not told the truth about his activities during several visits . Jones said the medical staff discussed this issue with Hinckley , who initially did not appear to view the issue as a big deal , but later understood it was a serious issue . Asked about the photographs of the d@@ enti@@ st , Jones said the photographs were of the woman gradu@@ ating from d@@ ental school and were &quot; not sal@@ acious . &quot; . The first step would allow Hinckley to have two visits of 17 days . That would be followed by six visits of 24 days . On March 30 , 1981 , Hinckley waited for President Reagan to leave a Washington Hotel after a speech . He opened fire and hit Reagan , his press secretary James Brady , Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington police officer Thomas Del@@ ah@@ an@@ ty .
While he will still be able to raise and spend campaign funds because he did not officially drop out , Cain &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s White House bid is effectively over . Cain said he came to the decision after assessing the impact that the allegations were having on his wife , his family and his supporters . Cain and his wife , Gloria , held hands as they walked up to the podium where Cain made his remarks in Atlanta . &quot; Your support has been un@@ wa@@ vering and un@@ dying , &quot; Cain told his supporters . Resp@@ ond@@ ents said they were most concerned that Cain does not understand important issues , but said the allegations against him contribute to their concern , the newspaper said . This week , White told the news media that she and Cain engaged in an on-@@ and-@@ off affair for more than 13 years . White issued a statement , through her attorney , after Cain &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s announcement Saturday . In a fun@@ d-@@ raising letter Tuesday night , Cain referred to White as &quot; troubled . &quot; .

( CNN ) -- Four years ago , Brandon Stan@@ ton became New York City &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s un@@ official phot@@ o-@@ chronic@@ ler . His first stop : Iraq and Jordan . Though his trip was &quot; months in the works , &quot; Stan@@ ton didn &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t anticip@@ ate that his arrival in Er@@ b@@ il , Iraq would coinc@@ ide with that of ISIS . &quot; My idea of what con@@ stitutes personal tragedy has been expanded a lot just listening to what these people are going through , &quot; admits Stan@@ ton . For the Y@@ az@@ id@@ is he approached -- from the student who had to abandon his long sought after M@@ aster &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s degree to flee bombs to the mother whose children can &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t stop crying for home -- Stan@@ ton found himself fal@@ ter at the prospect of pursuing his traditional line of questioning . &apos; P@@ ack a bag and get ready to run &apos; . The day Stan@@ ton landed in Iraq , ISIS captured the Mosul Dam . His time there , he admits , was often terri@@ fying . &quot; When I was in D@@ oh@@ uk , there was a moment I got a call in the middle of the night from UNICEF telling to pack a bag and get ready to run , because ISIS was shelling the town and had broken through the lines , &quot; he recalls . It was one of many moments , he admits , when he appreci@@ ated what it means to feel secure . And I realized that in the absence of physical security , no other lay@@ ers of life can really be experienced , &quot; he says . &quot; That constant uncertainty se@@ eps into your psy@@ c@@ he in a way that you can &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t really pin@@ point until you go back to a place that is secure . &quot; . For Stan@@ ton , that place was Jordan . &quot; I really noticed when I landed in Jordan , where the infr@@ astruc@@ tures was in place and there was no imminent threat , that there was a load lifted from my psy@@ c@@ he , &quot; he says . In the absence of immediate danger , there was hope .
Not for nothing was the name Nixon , Bush or D@@ ole on the GOP presidential ticket from 195@@ 2 to 2004 . In contrast , Democrats have favored the presidential candidate with the hot hand , rising from obsc@@ urity to the White House -- think Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton and Barack Obama . But a fresh@@ -@@ out-of-@@ the-@@ oven CNN presidential poll shows a fractured GOP field of new@@ com@@ ers with no clear front-@@ runner while the Democrats have given an unprecedented lead to a brand name of their own : Hillary Clinton . On the GOP side of the aisle , New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie narrowly leads the fractured field at 17 % , one point above Rep. Paul Ryan , best known as Mitt Romney &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s vice presidential running mate . But that doesn &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t seem to be the case for Ryan , who emerged from the 2012 presidential race arguably damaged by his association with the Romney campaign . Perhaps most interesting is the second tier of GOP candidates . Bel@@ ow Biden are first-@@ term Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 7 % , New York Gov. And while successful governors like Cuomo and O &@@ apos@@ ;@@ Mal@@ ley have earned the right to be taken seriously as presidential candidates , the party fai@@ thful don &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t seem to be much interested in buying what they are selling at the moment . If Clinton does not run for some reason , Democrats will quickly wake up to the aw@@ kward fact that they have almost no depth of the bench after two Obama terms . So there you have it : Democrats are be@@ having like Republicans , falling in line behind the big brand name domin@@ ating a race that is still three years away . And Republicans are be@@ having like Democrats , putting forward a fractured field with no clear front-@@ runners but elev@@ ating a New Jersey governor , a Wisconsin congressman and a Kentucky senator to the front of the pack .

H@@ AR@@ AR@@ E , Zimbabwe ( CNN ) -- Zimbab@@ wean lawmakers on Monday narrowly voted for L@@ ov@@ em@@ ore Moy@@ o as speaker of the parliament -- making him the first opposition lawmaker to hold the position in the country &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s history . Morgan Tsvangirai &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s MDC faction has a slim majority following parliamentary elections . The speaker of the parliament is the fourth most powerful post in Zimbabwe . Th@@ emb@@ a-@@ Ny@@ ath@@ i represented the spl@@ in@@ ter MDC faction led by Arthur Mut@@ amb@@ ara , but he had support of President Robert Mugabe &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s ZANU-PF party . The vote took place hours after Mugabe s@@ wore in lawmakers , five months after they were elected . Two members of the main MDC -- led by presidential candidate Morgan Tsvangirai -- were arrested as they arrived at the opening session , but they were released after a short time , according to a government spokesman . One of those detained -- Shu@@ wa Mu@@ di@@ wa -- appeared back in parliament , but the other member -- Eli@@ a J@@ emb@@ ere -- was not seen , according to sources . Att@@ end@@ ance at the session of parliament is important since the membership is closely divided between the MDC and the Mugabe &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s ZANU-PF . The ruling ZANU-PF party lost its majority in the 2@@ 10-@@ seat parliament in elections in March , but vote recoun@@ ts and political violence have delayed the body from conv@@ ening until now . Fin@@ al results gave 100 seats to an MDC faction led by Morgan Tsvangirai , the party &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s presidential candidate . President Robert Mugabe &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s ZANU-PF got 99 seats . Tsvangirai , who was locked in a bitter presidential contest with Mugabe , had ob@@ jected to Mugabe &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s decision to conven@@ e parliament , saying it could &quot; dec@@ ap@@ itate &quot; power-@@ sharing talks that have been on hold for the past two weeks . MDC party spokesman Nelson Cham@@ isa said all MDC members elected to parliament were expected to attend &quot; except those few M@@ Ps who are still in hiding . &quot; .
During 15 years of talking to high school students about sex and bullying , Lau@@ rie Hal@@ se Anderson has continued to get the same questions from boys : Why was the main character in her book , &quot; Spe@@ ak , &quot; so upset about what happened to her ? Anderson , who published the awar@@ d-winning novel in 1999 , believes the questions come from an honest place . They &@@ apos@@ ;@@ re teen boys , after all , growing up in a society where media and pop culture tell them women are created for sexual grati@@ fication . And yet , many parents still struggle to find the words or the courage to talk to teens about sex and in@@ tim@@ acy , Anderson said . As a mother who raised four girls , Anderson knows that parents today are navi@@ g@@ ating un@@ char@@ ted territory when it comes to adol@@ esc@@ ent sexuality , and they &@@ apos@@ ;@@ re doing it earlier than parents in other generations . For the 15th anniversary of &quot; Spe@@ ak , &quot; Anderson is lending her support to the R@@ ape , Ab@@ use &amp; Inc@@ est National Network , a resource for survivors of sexual violence . Anderson said she wrote &quot; Spe@@ ak &quot; based on her own experience of being raped as a teen . Although many students first encountered &quot; Spe@@ ak &quot; in high schools , it &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s now being taught in middle schools , Anderson said . &quot; It used to be that we teach girls not to be raped , but we need to start teaching boys not to be rap@@ ists , and that &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s a really hard thing for parents of boys to process , &quot; she said . The term &quot; young adult lit &quot; was hardly in use when Anderson wrote &quot; Spe@@ ak . &quot; A teacher who uses &quot; Spe@@ ak &quot; in her classroom told Anderson that she calls it &quot; res@@ ili@@ ence literature , &quot; a term Anderson said she is proud of . &quot; Spe@@ ak &quot; is about teen rape , the pressures of high school and the insul@@ arity of small-@@ town life , but most importantly , it &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s about over@@ coming stig@@ ma , Anderson said .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forc@@ i@@ bly inj@@ ecting them with psych@@ ot@@ ro@@ pic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation . Raymond So@@ e@@ o@@ th , pictured here with his wife , says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will . Two immigrants , Raymond So@@ e@@ o@@ th of Indonesia and Am@@ ad@@ ou Di@@ ou@@ f of Senegal in West Africa , told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will . &quot; The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced dru@@ gging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling , particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards , &quot; Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail . Respon@@ ding to Lieberman &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s written questions , Myers said 1,0@@ 73 immigration detainees had &quot; medical escor@@ ts &quot; for deportation since 2003 . Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7 , 2004 , he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him gro@@ gg@@ y for two days . See the document that shows So@@ e@@ o@@ th was injected . So@@ e@@ o@@ th &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s medical records indicate he was injected with C@@ og@@ enti@@ n and Hal@@ d@@ ol , even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness . In the records , the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remar@@ k So@@ e@@ o@@ th denies ever making . &quot; Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescri@@ be or ad@@ minister medication to detainees , &quot; the ICE statement said . But , Di@@ ou@@ f says , he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported . See Di@@ ou@@ f &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s stay of deportation document . If they lose , they may land back in the hands of ICE , once again facing deportation .

Dallas ( CNN ) -- Some may disagree whether George W. Bush was a &quot; un@@ iter , not a divi@@ der , &quot; as he liked to say , but he did get all five living presidents together for the dedication of his presidential library . At Thursday &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s event in Dallas , Democratic former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton praised Bush for his initiatives in Africa , and Bush defended his record . &quot; The political winds blow left and right , polls rise and fall , supporters come and go , but in the end , leaders are defined by the convictions they hold , &quot; Bush said at the ceremony for the George W. Bush Presidential Center . Bush has said he is aware that the opening of his presidential library would reopen debates over the Iraq War and the policies he pursued after the September 11 terrorist attacks . Bush kept his word and acted , Carter said . &quot; George W. Bush is responsible for that . &quot; . &quot; That &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s what President George W. Bush chose to do , &quot; Obama said . The center &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s library and museum take visitors through the turning points of Bush &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s two terms . Bush 43 : &apos; History will ultimately judge &apos; . As the son of another former president , Bush said he wouldn &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t mind seeing his brother Jeb Bush run for the highest office . If he could make the decision for Jeb , he would tell him to run for president , Bush said . But in an interview Thursday on NBC &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s &quot; Today , &quot; former first lady Barbara Bush said that while Jeb Bush is able to do the job , she would like to see other families in the White House . In addition to the library and museum , the Presidential Center includes the George W. Bush Institute , a public policy institute .
See the performance by Sebas@@ tien De La Cruz . Here &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s a sam@@ pling of some of the un@@ kind tweets that went flying around the Internet about Sebas@@ tien de la Cruz : . As for Sebas@@ tien , he said the racist comments have not f@@ az@@ ed him . &quot; For those that said something bad about me , I understand it &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s your opinion , &quot; said Sebas@@ tien to CNN . Sebas@@ tien has been singing since he was 5 but gained fame in 2012 after being on NBC &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s &quot; America &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s G@@ ot Tal@@ ent &quot; for singing his mar@@ i@@ achi ball@@ ads with hopes of winning to help his younger brother get surgery for his hearing problem . Juan de la Cruz , Sebas@@ tien &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s father , hasn &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t taken the negative comments personally at all . &quot; I think people reacted the way they did because Sebas@@ tien was wearing his mar@@ i@@ achi outfit , &quot; said de la Cruz , &quot; But , it doesn &@@ apos@@ ;@@ t make sense to listen to those people when most of the feedback we have gotten is positive . San Antonio supports Sebas@@ tien . &quot; . The blog highlighted 28 tweets from NBA fans who came off as off@@ ended and ash@@ amed that the Sp@@ urs would allow the boy , who happened to have been born and raised in San Antonio , to sing the nation &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s an@@ them . After the harsh reaction spread across the Internet , tweets supporting and defending Sebas@@ tien and v@@ oci@@ fer@@ ously den@@ ouncing his critics started to take over : . -- &quot; Why are pp@@ l so upset over a Hispanic singing the national an@@ them . -- And , from the American Latino Museum , &quot; We &@@ apos@@ ;@@ re proud of the 11-@@ year old San An@@ to-@@ native Sebas@@ tien de la Cruz for his amazing performance last night ! &quot; . It will take a lot more than some racist tweets to bring Sebas@@ tien down . Sebas@@ tien said today was like any other day , but he &@@ apos@@ ;@@ s always grateful to wake up to yet another day able to sing . See how Sebas@@ tien is handling the reaction .
